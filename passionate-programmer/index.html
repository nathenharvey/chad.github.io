<p id="N115D1"> In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values</a>,
      Robert Pirsig tells an enlightening story about how people in
      South India used to catch monkeys. I don’t know whether it’s true,
      but it teaches a useful lesson, so I’ll paraphrase it.</p>


<p id="N115D7"> The people of South India, having been pestered by monkeys
      over the years, developed an ingenious way of trapping
      them. They would dig a long, narrow hole in the ground and then
      use an equally long, slender object to widen the bottom of the
      hole. Then they would pour rice down into the wider portion at
      the bottom of the hole. </p>


<p id="N115DA"> Monkeys like to eat. In fact, that’s a large part of what
      makes them such pests. They’ll jump onto cars or risk running
      through large groups of people to snatch food right out of your
      hand. People in South India are painfully aware of this.
      (Believe me, it’s surprisingly unsettling to be standing
      serenely in a park and have a macaque come suddenly barreling
      through to snatch something from you.) </p>


<p id="N115DD"> So, according to Pirsig, the monkeys would come along,
      discover the rice, and stretch their arms deep into the
      hole. Their hands would be at the bottom. They would greedily
      clutch as much of the rice as possible into their hands, making
      a fist in the process. Their fists would fit into the larger
      portion of the hole, but the rest of the narrow opening was too
      small for the monkeys to pull their fists through. They’d be
      stuck. </p>


<p id="N115E0"> Of course, they could just let go of the food, and they’d be
      free. </p>


<p id="N115E3"> But, monkeys place a high value on food. In fact, they place
      such a high value on food that they cannot force themselves to
      let go of it. They’ll grip that rice until either it comes out
      of the ground or they die trying to pull it out. It was typically
      the latter that happened first. </p>


<p id="N115E6"> Pirisig tells this story to illustrate a concept he calls
      <span class="emph">value rigidity</span>. Value rigidity is what happens
      when you believe in the value of something so strongly that you
      can no longer objectively question it. The monkeys valued the
      rice so highly that when forced to make the choice between the
      rice and captivity or death, they couldn’t see that losing the
      rice was the right thing to do at the time. The story makes the
      monkeys seem really stupid, but most of us have our own
      equivalents to the rice. </p>


<p id="N115EC"> If you were asked whether it was a good idea to help
      feed starving children in developing countries, you would
      probably say “yes” without even thinking about
      it. If someone tried to argue the point with you, you might
      think they were crazy.  <span class="emph">This</span> is an example of value
      rigidity. You believe in this one thing so strongly that you
      can’t imagine <span class="emph">not</span> believing it. Clearly, not all
      values that we hold rigidly are bad. For most people, religion
      (or lack thereof) is also a set of personal beliefs and values
      that are unfaltering. </p>


<p id="N115F5"> But not all rigidly held values are good ones. Also, many times
      something that is good in one set of circumstances is not good
      in another. </p>


<p id="N115FC"> For example, it’s easy to get hung up on technology
      choices. This is especially true when our technology of choice
      is the underdog. We love the technology so much and place such a
      high value on defending it as a choice for adoption that we see
      every opportunity as a battle worth fighting—even when we’re
      advocating what is clearly the wrong choice. An example I
      encounter (and have probably been guilty of myself) is the
      overzealous Linux fan base. Many Linux users would put Linux on
      the desktop of every receptionist, office assistant, and
      corporate vice president with no regard for the fact that, in
      terms of usability, the toolset just doesn’t compare to much of
      the commercial software that’s available for a commercial
      operating system. You look foolish and make your customers
      unhappy when you give the right software to the wrong
      people. </p>


<p id="N115FF">
      It’s hard to tell you’re losing weight because you see yourself
      every day.  Value rigidity works the same way.  Since we live
      every day in our careers, it’s easy to develop value rigidity in
      our career choices. We know what has worked, and we keep doing
      it. Or, maybe you’ve always wanted to be promoted into
      management, so you keep striving toward that goal, regardless of
      how much you like <span class="emph">just programming.</span>
</p>


<p id="N11606"> It’s also possible for your technology of choice to become
      obsolete, leaving you suddenly without a foundation to stand
      on. Like a frog in a slowly heating pot of water, you can
      suddenly find yourself in a bad situation. Many of us
      in the mid-1990s swore by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetWare">Novell’s NetWare</a> platform when it
      came to providing file and print services in the
      enterprise. Novell was way ahead of its time with its
      directory services product, and those of us “in the
      know” were almost cocky in our criticism of competing
      technologies. Novell’s product was enjoying a healthy majority
      in market share, and it was hard to imagine the tide
      turning. </p>


<p id="N11609"> No single event made it obvious that Novell was
      losing to Microsoft.  Microsoft never made that magic Active
      Directory release that made us all say, “Wow!  Drop
      NetWare!” But, Netware has slowly gone from bleeding-edge
      innovator to legacy technology. For many NetWare
      administrators, the water was boiling before they ever even
      realized the pot was warm. </p>


<p id="N1160E"> Whether it is the direction your career is taking or the
      technologies you advocate and invest in, beware of monkey
      traps. Those originally intentional choices may become the
      last handful of rice you find yourself gripping prior to your
      career being clubbed to death.
    </p>


<h3>Act on It!</h3>


<ol>
<li>
<p id="N11617">
<span class="emph">Find your monkey traps</span>—What
            are <span class="emph">your</span> rigid assumptions? What are those
            values that guide your daily actions without you even
            consciously knowing it? </p>
<p id="N1161F"> Make a table with two columns, “Career”
            and “Technology.” Under each heading list
            the values that you hold unfalteringly true. For
            example, under “Career,” what have you <span class="emph">always</span>
            known to be one of your strengths? Or your weaknesses?
            What is your career <span class="emph">goal</span> (“I want to be
            a CEO!”)? What are the right ways to
            achieve your goal? </p>
<p id="N11628"> In the “Technology” column, list what you most
            value about the technologies you choose to invest in. What
            are the most important attributes of a technology that
            should be considered when making a choice? How do you make
            a scalable system? What’s the most productive environment
            in which to develop software? What are the best and worst
            platforms in general? </p>
<p id="N1162B"> When you have your list down and you feel like it’s
            fairly complete, go one at a time through the list and
            mentally reverse each statement. What if the opposite of
            each assertion were true? Allow yourself to honestly
            challenge each assertion. </p>
<p id="N1162E"> This is a list of your vulnerabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="N11632">
<span class="emph">Know your enemy</span>—Pick the technology you
            hate most, and do a project in it.  Developers tend to
            stratify themselves into competing camps. The .NET people
            hate J2EE, and the J2EE people hate .NET. The UNIX people
            hate Windows, and the Windows people hate UNIX. </p>
<p id="N11637"> Pick an easy project, and try to do a <span class="emph">great</span>
            application in the technology you hate. If you’re a Java
            person, show those .NET folks how a <span class="emph">real</span>
            developer uses their platform! Best case, you’ll learn
            that the technology you hate isn’t all that bad and that
            it is in fact possible to develop good code with
            it. You’ll also have a (granted, undeveloped) new skill
            that you might need to take advantage of in the
            future. Worst case, the exercise will be a practice
            session for you, and you’ll have better fodder for your
            arguments. </p>
