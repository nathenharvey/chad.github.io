  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent the last weekend at the No Fluff Just Stuff (<a
href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com">www.nofluffjuststuff.com</a>) Ohio<br />
Java Software Symposium in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>
<p>Jim Weirich (<a href="http://onestepback.org/">onestepback.org/</a>) took<br />
much better notes than I did, so I&#8217;ll leave it to him to chronicle<br />
what we saw. We happened to go to the same sessions by chance (or was it<br />
something about the fact that we were both Ruby geeks at a Java conference<br />
and were attracted to the same topics?).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Jay Zimmerman (conference organizer) has done an excellent job by sticking<br />
to a few guiding principles:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>No vendor sales-pitch presentations</li>
<li>Keeping it small and personal (encouraging speakers to interact with<br />
attendees)</li>
<li>Practical technical presentations that attendees can apply to their work</li>
<li>Constant feedback collection from attendees and adaptation of the<br />
content/format as a result (it really shows).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>I had a great time. The sessions were fantastic, but the best thing was<br />
meeting a lot of smart people and participating in some interesting side<br />
conversations. I&#8217;ve only been to a couple of conferences, but from<br />
what I&#8217;ve seen the main draw for me will always be the<br />
between-the-sessions chat time.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Primary takeaways from the conference:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Java people sure do use a lot of <span class="caps">XML</span>. I get the feeling they&#8217;d like<br />
to be using a scripting language, and they use <span class="caps">XML</span> as an attempt to fill<br />
this void.</li>
<li>Naked Objects (<a
href="http://www.nakedobjects.org">www.nakedobjects.org</a>) is much more<br />
interesting than I thought it was. I thought it was a fascinating novelty<br />
when I first saw it, but seeing Dave (<a
href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave">pragprog.com/pragdave</a>) speak about<br />
it made me realize just how important it might be.</li>
<li>Some of the smartest Java people in the industry seem to spend a lot of<br />
effort working around road blocks in the Java language and accompanying<br />
acronyms.</li>
<li>I realized just how much time software developers spend on plumbing vs.<br />
value added business logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>In short, if you&#8217;re a software developer or someone who works with<br />
software developers, I would highly recommend checking out the web site and<br />
looking for a No Fluff Just Stuff symposium in a city near you. It&#8217;s<br />
well worth the price of admission.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon, I was driving home listening to an audio copy of The Art of<br />
Happiness ( <a
href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2TLSUZ2VRE&isbn=1573221112&TXT=Y&itm=1">search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2TLSUZ2VRE&amp;isbn=1573221112&amp;<span class="caps">TXT</span>=Y&amp;itm=1</a><br />
) by Howard C. Cutler and The Dalai Lama. Somewhere near the beginning of<br />
the book (I don&#8217;t know the page number offhand, since I was listening<br />
to it in the car), I had one of those don&#8217;t-forget-this kinds of<br />
thoughts. Cutler was talking about one of his first meetings with the Dalai<br />
Lama. Being a psychiatrist, he explained some of the problems he&#8217;s<br />
faced in his daily work and asked the Dalai Lama for his views on what<br />
might have been causing the sufferers to go through the things they were<br />
going through. After a brief period of deep thought, followed by laughter,<br />
the Dalai Lama shocked Cutler with the answer: &quot;I don&#8217;t<br />
know&quot;.</p>
<p>
<p>The Dalai Lama, who has spent his entire life in disciplined pursuit of<br />
happiness, doesn&#8217;t spend his time trying to figure out what makes<br />
people tick. Our minds are too complex, he says, to fully understand how<br />
they work. Instead, Buddhism advocates a simple approach to get you going<br />
in the right direction and a conceptual framework to help you stay on<br />
track. At it&#8217;s core, that is in fact all Buddhism is.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The don&#8217;t-forget-this-thought was my realization that a lot of the<br />
power in Buddhist philosophy (for me, at least) is fueled by its<br />
simplicity. And, its simplicity is driven by its goal-oriented nature.<br />
Western science confronts complexity head-on by whipping out the<br />
intellectual scalpel and trying to decompose it from the top down. Buddhist<br />
thought, on the other hand, acknowledges complexity and focuses not on<br />
decomposing it but on finding a few things that work and moving forward.<br />
There&#8217;s a heavy focus in Buddhism on how to adapt and learn how to be<br />
happy versus understanding how the mind works and creating a<br />
one-size-fits-all recipe for happiness. This goal-orientedness is what<br />
drives the Dalai Lama to always speak of &quot;Happiness vs.<br />
Suffering&quot; and not &quot;Happiness vs. Unhappiness&quot;. It has<br />
always sounded strange to my western ears, like a word that rhymes with<br />
itself. But, &quot;suffering&quot; is something that exists that we can<br />
avoid. &quot;Unhappiness&quot; isn&#8217;t as actionable.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Thinking of it this way, I recognized a connection that I knew existed and<br />
I&#8217;ve been fishing for lately. Extreme Programming, with its four core<br />
values and 12 core practices (<a
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap">c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap</a>)<br />
is in some loose ways reminiscent of Buddhism and its Four Noble Truths<br />
leading to the Eight-Fold Path (<a
href="http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble.htm">www.buddhanet.net/4noble.htm</a>).<br />
In both cases, the four antecedents lead to a slightly longer subsequent<br />
list of practices. And, both present simple, adaptive approaches to dealing<br />
with complex problems (though comparing the complexity of software<br />
development and the pursuit of happiness is admittedly a bit far fetched).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As I drove down the freeway listening to the Dalai Lama&#8217;s reaction to<br />
Cutler&#8217;s Western-centric questions, I was reminded of Kent<br />
Beck&#8217;s driving analogy from Extreme Programming Explained ( <a
href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=35062ST2KB&isbn=0201616416&TXT=Y&itm=1">search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=35062ST2KB&amp;isbn=0201616416&amp;<span class="caps">TXT</span>=Y&amp;itm=1</a><br />
). XP, he says, is like driving a car. You don&#8217;t line up the wheel<br />
and step on the gas until you reach your destination. You don&#8217;t even<br />
do that to travel in a straight line&#8212;the roads aren&#8217;t that<br />
perfect. They can&#8217;t be predicted. Instead, you learn a few guiding<br />
principles of driving and use them to adapt your way to your destination.<br />
You&#8217;re always steering. This is core to both Buddhism and Extreme<br />
Programming.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When I got home, I fired up my news aggregator and saw Keith Ray&#8217;s<br />
post ( <a
href="http://homepage.mac.com/keithray/blog/2003/07/07/">homepage.mac.com/keithray/blog/2003/07/07/</a><br />
), &quot;These are not opposites&quot;. Keith pulls together several<br />
sources discussing the meaning of &quot;agile&quot; and whether or not it<br />
should be considered opposite to &quot;disciplined&quot; (another example<br />
of the effect of the intellectual scalpel). For some reason, especially<br />
with XP (maybe it&#8217;s the name?), outside observers get the impression<br />
that agile processes advocate a loose-cannon approach to development.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It just so happens that Buddhism suffers the same misconception. Buddhism<br />
is often dismissed as being nihilistic and self-centered. If it&#8217;s all<br />
about being happy, we can just do what we want, right? (If there&#8217;s no<br />
upfront design, then there&#8217;s <b>no</b> design, right?)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Toward their end goals, Buddhism and Extreme Programming are both extremely<br />
rigorous disciplines. To say that either is an anti-discipline demonstrates<br />
a fundamental lack of understanding. They are both adaptive. They are both<br />
evolutionary. And, they are both more concerned with providing a loose<br />
framework for things we <b>know</b> will work than with decomposing the<br />
problem domain into a scientific formula.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, the ultimate problem isn&#8217;t &quot;discipline&quot; versus<br />
&quot;anarchy&quot;. It&#8217;s &quot;adaptive&quot; versus<br />
&quot;predictive&quot; and the misconceptions that each of these imply.</p>

<p>
<p>&#8230;I would say that Rael is primed and ready for Ruby (<a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a>). Rael, have you<br />
tried it?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to be pushy or evangelical here, but Rael&#8217;s post<br />
reminds me of my own flirtations with Python. I would stick a toe in,<br />
notice how it felt pretty good, and then go back and do real work in Perl.<br />
It had everything for me except&#8212;to borrow from The Tipping Point ( <a
href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2TLSUZ2VRE&isbn=0316316962&TXT=Y&itm=1">search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2TLSUZ2VRE&amp;isbn=0316316962&amp;<span class="caps">TXT</span>=Y&amp;itm=1</a><br />
)&#8212;the &quot;Stickiness&quot; factor. My &quot;anal-retentive &gt;<br />
1/2&quot; kept luring me back to Python, but the smaller&#8212;and<br />
apparently more dominant&#8212;part of my personality resisted.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When I found Ruby, the majority of my multiple personalities were (for<br />
once) in harmony, and it stuck.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For a fairly interesting discussion of why some have chosen Ruby over<br />
Python, have a look at this nearly-2-year-old thread on the ruby-talk<br />
mailing list. It&#8217;s laden with some of the inevitable<br />
&quot;noise&quot; and bird-walking of any open discussion on the internet,<br />
but it also has some interesting insights into why someone would feel<br />
strongly about one (but not both) of two very similar languages:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This evening I spent a few minutes (literally) and whipped a small hack<br />
(&quot;spike&quot; for you XPers among us) of a Ruby version of TestDox<br />
(see <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/AgileDox.rdoc,v">AgileDox</a>).<br />
I&#8217;m going to use it on my own code for a while before doing anything<br />
proper with it. Right now, it&#8217;s a whopping 37 lines of Ruby. If<br />
you&#8217;re interested, have a look here:</p>

<p><a
href="http://www.chadfowler.com/ruby/testdox.rb.txt">www.chadfowler.com/ruby/testdox.rb.txt</a></p>

<p>
<p>You can run it like so:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  ruby testdox.rb test_source1.rb test_source2.rb (etc.)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thoughtworks&#8217; Joe Walnes has posted a link (<a
href="http://joe.truemesh.com/blog/archives/agile/000047.html">joe.truemesh.com/blog/archives/agile/000047.html</a>)<br />
to an interesting project called <b>TestDox</b> (<a
href="http://agiledox.sourceforge.net/">agiledox.sourceforge.net/</a>).<br />
Given a suite of JUnit (<a href="http://www.junit.org">www.junit.org</a>)<br />
tests, it generates documentation.</p>
<p>
<p>Like <span class="caps">FIT</span> (<a href="http://fit.c2.com">fit.c2.com</a>), this is an<br />
interesting bridge between executable code and documentation. TestDox<br />
converts camelCasedTestMethodNames into separate words, so this code</p>
</p>
<pre>
  public class DogTest extends TestCase
  {
    public void testBarksAtCats() {}
    public void testEatsALot() {}
    public void testSleepsWhenNotBarkingOrEating() {}
  }
</pre>
<p>
<p>&#8230;would produce the documentation that looks basically like<br />
(untested):</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><b>Dog</b></p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Barks at cats</li>
<li>Eats a lot</li>
<li>Sleeps when not barking or eating</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>This has arguably limited usefulness, and it depends trickily on class and<br />
method naming conventions. But, it starts the ideas flowing, and<br />
TestDox&#8217;s parent project (<b>Agiledox</b>) will hopefully expand and<br />
explore these much further. It may sound like heresy to the XP world, but<br />
I&#8217;d be interested in being able to do this sort of thing round-trip<br />
(documentation -&gt; test -&gt; documentation -&gt; test -&gt;<br />
documentation -&gt; &#8230;)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In my own unit testing, I haven&#8217;t always been so methodical about<br />
using method names that describe a characteristic of the entity being<br />
tested. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t use descriptive names, but I may<br />
include tests with names like &quot;testEatBadTastingFood()&quot;, which<br />
describes a specific scenario but not an ongoing behaviour of dogs. Running<br />
my tests through TestDox might generate misleading documentation.<br />
It&#8217;s not that dogs generally eat food they don&#8217;t like. I just<br />
wanted to test what a dog would/should do in the eventuality that they<br />
<b>did</b> eat bad food. I&#8217;m not sure if my current behaviour is bad<br />
or good, but it will definitely be something I think about next time I sit<br />
down to do some coding.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>A fear I have is that, with this tool in place, I may be tempted to think<br />
about what the generated documentation will look like as I write my tests.<br />
This would create a new and potentially conflicting objective in my test<br />
writing. And, since I tend to do test driven design, it would ultimately<br />
impact my design and coding decisions.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not ruling out the possibility that this change in thinking would<br />
<b>improve</b> my code. I guess I&#8217;ll just have to try and find out.</p>

href="http://www.idg.net/ic_1322387_9677_1-5042.html">www.idg.net/ic_1322387_9677_1-5042.html</a>).<br />
Apparently, you wear it on your eye glasses or cap, it buffers 30 seconds<br />
of video (of what you&#8217;re seeing) at a time, and you can press a<br />
button whenever you like to save the previous 30 seconds permanently. They<br />
(<a href="http://www.mydejaview.com">www.mydejaview.com</a>) have another<br />
model that can save up to 4 hours.</p>
<p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether to be excited or frightened, but I&#8217;m<br />
leaning toward excited. It&#8217;s still pretty bulky, but I imagine<br />
another year&#8217;ll solve that. I&#8217;d like to add a small playback<br />
display, so when I space out during a conversation, I can gracefully<br />
recover by pressing the capture button, excusing myself, and rewinding the<br />
last 30 seconds:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  &amp;quot;How's that sound to you, Chad?&amp;quot;
  (wakes up)
  &amp;quot;Uh...yea...hold on just a moment.  I'll be right back.&amp;quot;
  (leaves room, plays back video, returns)
  &amp;quot;Right, then...&amp;quot; (potentially less ignorant conversation ensues)
</pre>
<p>
<p>Even more exciting&#8212;but farther off in the future&#8212;is the<br />
possibility of combining the audio portion of this technology with wireless<br />
networking, speech recognition, and text data mining. Imagine the power of<br />
having a personal, searchable (<a
href="index.cgi/Computing/LatentSemanticIndexing.rdoc,v">LatentSemanticIndexing</a>),<br />
index of every conversation you have and everything you hear. May that<br />
sounds a little spooky? Doesn&#8217;t feel quite right to you? That&#8217;s<br />
just the feeling of old age creeping over you&#8230;it&#8217;s OK. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently, Microsoft is brewing up their own new search engine technology,<br />
which has got some people thinking they&#8217;re about to try to<br />
Netscape-ize Google (<a
href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2071">scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2071</a>).<br />
I don&#8217;t really buy into the idea that any company is evil (<a
href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%22microsoft+is+evil%22&FORM=SMCRT">search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%22microsoft+is+evil%22&amp;<span class="caps">FORM</span>=<span class="caps">SMCRT</span></a>),<br />
but I still like this idea: <a
href="http://www.idlewords.com/boycott.pl">www.idlewords.com/boycott.pl</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>The idea is that, if enough people setup their robots.txt to disallow<br />
Microsoft&#8217;s bot, it will create holes in MS&#8217;s relevance<br />
ranking, rendering the search engine ineffective. I don&#8217;t want to<br />
ruin Microsoft. But, it would be extremely interesting if a simple,<br />
distributed idea like this actually had an effect on a seemingly inevitable<br />
outcome.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for? Join in! The numbers are small now.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The disadvantage here is that when Microsoft <b>does</b> kill the<br />
competition, your site won&#8217;t be indexed. I think can live with that<br />
for at least as long as it takes to `rm robots.txt` and get crawled.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I guess it&#8217;s been a couple of years now since Dave (<a
href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave">pragprog.com/pragdave</a>) and I had a<br />
discussion about attempting to extend some of the benefits of paired<br />
programming (<a
href="http://www.pairprogramming.com">www.pairprogramming.com</a>) to<br />
individual programming sessions. Unfortunately, this 5 minute-ish<br />
conversation resulted in little more than a dangling Wiki link (<a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?MorePragmaticTips">www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?MorePragmaticTips</a>)<br />
with a catchy tag line. I&#8217;ve revisited it occasionally to see if<br />
anyone had anything interesting to say.</p>
<p>
<p>In his latest Code Kata installment (<a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataSeven.rdoc,v">www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata/KataSeven.rdoc,v</a>),<br />
Dave has&#8212;probably unintentionally&#8212;started filling in the hole.<br />
He suggests a structured, 3-step approach to reviewing your own code, with<br />
the goal of developing new perspectives in the process. It&#8217;s this<br />
same role-playing-ish type of process that I&#8217;ve had in mind since we<br />
discussed the &quot;solo pairing&quot; idea.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The Zen Buddhists [oh no&#8230;there he goes with that Buddhism thing<br />
again] have developed a concept called &quot;Beginner&#8217;s Mind&quot;.<br />
Shunryu Suzuki-roshi, author of &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#8217;s Mind&quot;<br />
(<a
href="http://www.booksite.com/texis/scripts/oop/click_ord/addcart.html?sid=3471&Buy=0834800799">www.booksite.com/texis/scripts/oop/click_ord/addcart.html?sid=3471&amp;Buy=0834800799</a>),<br />
writes:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  &amp;quot;In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the
   expert's there are few.&amp;quot;
</pre>
<p>
<p>As per my limited understanding, the goal is to always think as if you were<br />
seeing or doing something for the first time. Beginners aren&#8217;t<br />
usually proud or boastful. They are impressionable. Beginners don&#8217;t<br />
already <b>know</b> why things are the way they are or what the best course<br />
of action is at any given moment. They&#8217;re more likely to actually<br />
stop and look around them.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This strikes a chord with the solo pairing idea. As we program lone,<br />
there&#8217;s a lot of seemingly autonomous stuff that can happen without<br />
any intentional thought. We get into a rhythm, not noticing the familiar<br />
scenery around us. Like driving to work every day, we are dulled to the<br />
routine of the environment in which we work. Think about it next time you<br />
sit down by yourself to write a program: How conscious are you of the names<br />
you choose for variables, methods, or classes? For the &quot;easy&quot;<br />
problems, how critical are you of your own norms and rituals? I&#8217;m not<br />
suggesting that you aren&#8217;t <b>conscientious</b>&#8212;in fact it<br />
might be conscientiousness that has led many of us to a rigid (most of us<br />
prefer to say &quot;correct&quot;) way of approaching many of life&#8217;s<br />
little problems.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But, when you&#8217;re sitting with another person&#8212;especially if this<br />
person is a beginner&#8212;they&#8217;re not inside your head with you.<br />
They&#8217;re more likely to question your established protocol. &quot;Why<br />
do you put &#8216;p underscore&#8217; in those variable names?&quot; This<br />
might be a little frustrating at first until you irritatedly answer,<br />
&quot;Because it shows that they&#8217;re parameters to the method. Our old<br />
code&#8217;s methods were so long and jumbled that you often couldn&#8217;t<br />
remember where a variable was declared, so we had to do this. Thank God<br />
we&#8217;ve stopped coding like that&#8230;hmm, why <b>do</b> I put those<br />
&#8216;p underscore&#8217;s there?&quot;</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Dave asks:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  &amp;quot;However, doing this six months after you write code is not the best way
   of developing good software today. So the underlying challenge of this
   kata is this: how can we get into the habit of critically reviewing
   the code that we write, as we write it?&amp;quot;
</pre>
<p>
<p>Maybe we could replace the word &quot;critically&quot; here with<br />
&quot;innocently&quot; to achieve a different but still beneficial effect?</p>
