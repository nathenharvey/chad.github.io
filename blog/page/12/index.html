  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brazilian Rails expert and author, <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com">Fabio Akita</a> I recently did an <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/articles/2007/05/07/conversando-com-chad-fowler">interview</a> with me for his Portuguese Rails weblog.</p>
<p>I bet you didn&#8217;t know I was fluent in Portuguese, did you?!</p>
<p>If, for some reason, <em>you</em> don&#8217;t read Portuguese, he&#8217;s been kind of enough to translate the interview into English <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/pages/chadfowler">here</a>.</p>
<p>Fabio has an excellent interview style.  I really enjoyed it and I think it came out really well.  Fabio has been doing a ton of other interview lately in an effort to shine a light on Rails in Brazil.  If you read Portuguese, keep an eye on his <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/articles/category/entrevistas">interview category</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey guess what?  <a href="http://rubycentral.org/news/2007/05/01/rubyconf-2007/">RubyConf 2007</a> is going to be in Charlotte, NC this year.  November 2-4.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have a new page up at <a href="http://rubyconf.org">http://rubyconf.org</a> soon on which  you can focus all of your obsessive energies as you wait for registration to open.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to be able to fit a few more people in this year, but it&#8217;s impossible to know how Ruby&#8217;s continued growth will affect attendance.</p>
<p>Ruby hackers, start getting those talk ideas ready.  We&#8217;ll open up a call for proposals soonish as well.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What do you have cooking on your Rails project? The community wants to know!</p>
<p><img src="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/images/fr_arr_medium.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>When the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/index.html">first Rails Recipes book</a> was written, most of the Rails knowledge was concentrated in a small group of experts. These days, with new Rails applications being launched almost weekly and so many different problems being solved, the State of the Art is more evenly spread across the community. In order to capture what&#8217;s happening in the Rails community, we&#8217;d like the second Rails Recipe book to incorporate advanced recipes from the community&#8217;s best and brightest.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s your chance to share tasty dishes that others may have never imagined they could make. We (<a href="http://clarkware.com">Mike</a> and <a href="http://chadfowler.com">Chad</a>) will help you prepare your recipe for inclusion in the upcoming <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_arr/index.html">Advanced Rails Recipes</a> book, including reviewing and testing the code, and you&#8217;ll get all the credit.</p>
<p>To propose a recipe idea, here&#8217;s all we need from you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A paragraph or two describing the problem that the recipe solves</li>
	<li>A sentence or two indicating what the solution will be</li>
	<li>You should already have working code. You can send some along if it helps convey your idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Email your idea to us at railsrecipes@gmail.com by May 25th (but if you&#8217;ve already got an idea in mind, go ahead and send it today!). We&#8217;ll review your idea and let you know by May 31st if we can fit it in the book. After that, we&#8217;ll start working together to get your recipe into the book!</p>
<p>If your recipe is selected, your name, bio, and link to your site/blog will appear in the book. And you&#8217;ll receive a complimentary copy of the book, of course.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starbucks has forcefully(*) created its own little flavor of the English you use when ordering coffee.  Somehow &#8220;tall&#8221; means &#8220;small&#8221;.   Instead of medium, you order a &#8220;grande&#8221;.  Then there&#8217;s &#8220;room&#8221; and &#8220;drip&#8221;&#8212;-neither of which mean anything to me as a fairly enthusiastic coffee drinker.</p>
<p>High resolution experience.  Specialized language is a good sign according to people like Kathy, etc.</p>
<p>But is it actually about the users?  I don&#8217;t know many users who like it.  Some are intimidated.  More are disgusted.  Some (like me) got tired of hearing Starbucks employees correct them(*) and now guiltily find themselves saying &#8220;grande&#8221; when they mean &#8220;medium&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a customer, none of this makes me feel like &#8220;I rule&#8221;.  It makes me feel stupid and, because I&#8217;ve bent to the ridiculous language, it makes me feel cheap.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, I&#8217;m finding more frequently than not, that Starbucks employees uniformly mispronounce their own ridiculous names for things.  Particularly, it&#8217;s &#8220;venti&#8221; (ven-tee), not ventay.  But they all say ventay.</p>
<p>http://starbucksgossip.typepad.com/<em>/2006/04/yet_another</em>new.html</p>
<ul>
	<li>Yes, &#8220;forcefully&#8221;.  I haven&#8217;t confirmed this, but I&#8217;m pretty certain there&#8217;s some corporate mandate which says that if a customer manages to order a beverage without using the Starbucks terminology, the employee must rudely repeat the order back in Starbucks-speak.  Enough times and customers will bend to the company&#8217;s will.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Running a nonprofit is hard work.  But it&#8217;s all worth it when you get votes of confidence like the following email I received today from <a href="mailto:daneel.olivaw.3000@gmail.com">Mark Morton</a>:</p>
Forgive me if I have contacted the wrong person&#8230;this message is for whoever is running rubycentral.org
(which   is currently down).

You say RubyCentral is a &#8220;a growing web resource for everything to do with the Ruby language&#8221;, yet all I find are
a few tired articles dated from 2000?  Is this the same RubyCentral that is co-sponsoring RubyConf Europe
2007? (I hope not!) Nothing about the conference here?  Your <span class="caps">FAQ</span> link is broken, as is your feedback <span class="caps">SEND</span>
button on the Links page.  Sheesh!

If the above is true, it seems to me that RubyCentral is more of an <em>embarrassment</em> to the Ruby community.
Please get your act together, if only for the sake of the language.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We at <a href="http://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central</a> have been sponsoring a <a href="http://rubycentral.org/news/2006/07/28/ruby-central-announces-regional-conference-grant-program-2006/">regional conference grant program</a> this year.   <a href="http://rubyconfmi.org/">Several</a> <a href="http://mtnwestruby.org/">little</a> <a href="http://www.goruco.com/">ruby conferences</a> have <a href="http://rubyhoedown.com">popped up</a> around the US and abroad.</p>
<p>Having co-organized <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a>, <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a>, and the <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/">European RailsConf</a> since their inceptions, I thought I&#8217;d throw some thoughts into my weblog for the benefit of anyone who might like to put together a small conference.  I like small conferences.</p>
<p>This is a somewhat unstructured (though mostly chronological) brain dump.  If you have additional ideas, please do provide them in the comments or link your own weblog posts here.  I&#8217;m absolutely sure I haven&#8217;t covered everything.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Guess at how many people you can attract.  Guess conservatively.  If you guess too high you&#8217;re going to lose some money.</li>
	<li>Decide how much you would like the conference to cost to attend (the price per ticket).</li>
	<li>Pick a location (city, state, country) based on the first two things.  If you want attendees to pay as little as possible, put it in a cheap enough place.</li>
	<li>Find a venue.  Hopefully you can find one that will cost you little enough that it allows you to charge as little as you&#8217;re hoping with the desired number of attendees.  Otherwise you may have to adjust.  The venue will probably require a deposit.  You might be able to save money by finding a university or somewhere similar which will sponsor and/or host you.</li>
	<li>If you&#8217;re planning a Ruby-related conference, apply for a Ruby Central <a href="http://rubycentral.org/news/2006/07/28/ruby-central-announces-regional-conference-grant-program-2006/">regional conference grant</a>.</li>
	<li>Get someone to make a nice looking web site.  An ugly web site will make a noticeable impact on registrations for a new conference.</li>
	<li>Get someone to design t-shirts, name badges, and/or programs.  Budget for them.  Sites like <a href="http://customink.com">http://customink.com</a> are the best way to go.</li>
	<li>Try to get at least one &#8220;name&#8221; to agree to attend.  Maybe you can get a sponsor to pay to fly someone well-known in.   If you keep it community-oriented you can get someone with a name without having to pay them.  If you can&#8217;t get someone with a name, it&#8217;s not the end of the world, but you&#8217;ll probably have to keep the estimated numbers small as a result.</li>
	<li>Announce the conference with the name of the well-known speaker.  Generate a little buzz and lay out a schedule (Call For Proposals (<span class="caps">CFP</span>) happens on this date, speakers announced on this date, registration on this date, conference on this date, etc.)</li>
	<li>Write a good <span class="caps">CFP</span>.  Describe what you&#8217;re looking for in talks, the motivation for the conference, etc.</li>
	<li>Send out the <span class="caps">CFP</span>.  Try to get it on Ruby web sites and all the appropriate mailing lists.  Get people you know to blog it, etc.  You&#8217;ll probably need some kind of system for accepting the proposals as well.  Make sure you collect speaker bio, photos, and abstracts while the proposals are being collected.  Otherwise you&#8217;ll never be able to get all of them later when you need them.</li>
	<li>Get some notable community members to help you vote on the proposals.  At least one.  Announce this person or persons on your site as being in the program committee.  This&#8217;ll help build credibility.  Perhaps you should actually do this before you announce the conference, so it&#8217;s all part of the initial package.</li>
	<li>Notify all of the accepted speakers.  Get them to confirm that they&#8217;re still on for the conference, so you don&#8217;t end up with last minute slots to fill due to speakers backing out.</li>
	<li>Assume that, despite the efforts of the previous step, you&#8217;re going to have last-minute slots to fill.  Find a volunteer or volunteers who can be ready with a talk in case you need it.</li>
	<li>Announce the program.  Make it as detailed as you can.  Don&#8217;t skimp here.  It helps with registration.</li>
	<li>Get someone to make some nice &#8220;Speaking at Blah&#8221; badges for the speakers to put on their web sites.</li>
	<li>Get someone to make some nice &#8220;Attending Blah&#8221; badges for the attendees who&#8217;ve registered to put on their web sites.</li>
	<li>Figure out how you&#8217;re going to accept registrations.  In my experience, accepting credit cards (and <span class="caps">NOT</span> checks) is a really good plan.  It&#8217;s hard to deal with checks.  People end up not paying or just not showing up at all.  That costs you money if it seriously screws with your budget.  There are services you can use to do this.  Acteva, Regonline, etc.</li>
	<li>Open registration in a flurry of spam, blog posts, and public demonstrations.</li>
	<li>Plan to do something like serial interviews, articles, etc. with and/or by your speakers.  This will help get the word out while actually creating something of value for the community on the net.</li>
	<li>Sell out the conference (or at least sell enough that you don&#8217;t lose money from it (unless that&#8217;s OK with you)).</li>
	<li>Stay in touch with the venue.  For the conference, you&#8217;ll need to worry about seating (classroom seating is the best), projectors, screens, sound (probably best to have a clip-on microphone as well as a wireless hand-held for audience questions), and power (attendees will want to plug their laptops in&#8212;-you need power strips and extension cords).</li>
	<li>You may want to audio- or video-record the conference sessions.  Plan early.  Ask speakers if it&#8217;s OK.  Create and get them to sign a release, allowing you to record and post their talks.</li>
	<li>Put together and mail out logistics info for both speakers and attendees.  Be explicit about where they should stay, when they should come, who pays for what, etc.  It&#8217;s good to get this all done before anyone shows up.</li>
	<li>Print name badges, t-shirts, etc.  Print some blank name badges to adjust for mistakes you might have made (or at-door registration if you&#8217;re allowing that).  Also print programs.  People like to have the paper.</li>
	<li>Get to the conference early.  Check the screen, projector, sound, etc.</li>
	<li>Get volunteers for the first day of the conference.  You&#8217;ll need someone to stand at a registration desk, giving out name tags, t-shirts, programs, etc.  Someone else (probably you) will need to be available for fire fighting.  This is everything from getting the venue to refill the coffee to dealing with attendees who have erroneously been given parking tickets.</li>
	<li>Before the talks start, establish a protocol for helping your speakers stay on time.  In general, speakers think they don&#8217;t have enough material to fill the available time.  In general, speakers have way too much material to fill the available time.  Make sure they know how much time they have for their slot, bring a large digital clock to place on the podium or table so they can see it, and establish a person whose job is to communicate the remaining time to the speaker.</li>
	<li>Schedule slack in between the talks.  Plan for short breaks between every talk.  You may need to eat some of this time if the program runs over schedule (which is likely to happen).</li>
	<li>Make meal breaks longer than you think they need to be.</li>
	<li>Plan some gap times for attendees to chat.  They really like that.  Don&#8217;t feel like you have to fill every hour of the day with speakers lecturing.</li>
	<li>Plan an introduction during which you go through logistics (restating the schedule, pointing out restrooms, instructions for how to use the network if there is one, how to find out where to eat, etc.).</li>
	<li>Have the bios of your speakers during the event.  Introduce each speaker, so the speaker doesn&#8217;t have to wrestle post-break attention from the audience.  When trying to focus on the real topic of a presentation, the speakers should not have to think about asking people to sit down and be quiet.  Ideally, every talk starts with a welcoming round of applause from the audience.  It&#8217;s your job as organizer to make this happen.</li>
	<li>Have someone coordinate with the speakers to collect and post their presentation files (if they agree).  When these materials (and perhaps audio and/or video) are posted, announce them publicly.  If you&#8217;re going to do the conference again, you&#8217;ll want people who <em>weren&#8217;t</em> there to read about what happened and wish they had gone.</li>
	<li>During the event, take lots of photos and ask attendees to do the same.  Establish a flickr tag to use when posting pictures as well as weblog entries.  Before the conference, set up a way to syndicate these things onto your conference web site (or at least link to them).  Highlight live weblogging during the conference both online (your web site) and via announcing highlights and encouraging it during the conference.</li>
	<li>Create some mechanism for collecting feedback.  A simple paper survey works or you could build a small Web app.  Collect feedback <em>at</em> the event.  Afterward is too late.  People won&#8217;t give feedback if you wait too long, and their impressions will be fuzzier after they&#8217;ve gone home and gone back to work.  After the conference, analyze the feedback, summarize it and file away a plan for what you&#8217;re going to change next time.  If you don&#8217;t file it away, you&#8217;ll forget.</li>
	<li>After the conference, link to any and all conference reviews or writeups that you can find.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone&#8217;s favorite TV nerd, <a href="http://leoville.vox.com/library/post/tumbl%C3%A9o.html">Leo Laporte</a> has a <a href="http://tumbleo.com">tumblelog</a>.</p>
<p>As a Leo fan myself, I was excited to see that he pointed to our humble tumblelog, <a href="http://project.ioni.st/">project.ioni.st</a>.  Welcome to the wonderful world of tumblelogging, Leo.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even cooler is that Leo is doing his tumblelogging via a new service called <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>.  Tumblr is apparently <a href="http://tumblr.com/faqs">also inspired by</a> project.ioni.st.</p>
<p>Tumblr just may get a lot of people to finally get going with a tumblelog.  Just today, <a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com">Pat Eyler</a> start his own for <a href="http://on-ruby.tumblr.com/">On Ruby</a>, which is sure to be a source of interesting Ruby info.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These days, with all the buzz around rich browser-based client development, our applications are more and more likely to include a large number of external resources.  <a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/">Beautiful little icons</a>, JavaScript <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">infrastructure</a> and <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">effects</a> libraries, and external <span class="caps">CSS</span> files add up quickly.  As soon as you add a line such as:</p>
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %&gt;
<p>to your Rails application (never mind whether this practice is optimal&#8212;it&#8217;s pervasive), the browser has to download several separate files to completely load a single page.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty far to the left on the premature optimization continuum, so I wouldn&#8217;t worry about this kind of thing unless it were a problem.  It turns out it really <em>is</em> a problem.  Especially if your application is being accessed via <span class="caps">HTTPS</span>.  Not only does <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> add the overhead of encryption and encryption to your request, but browsers will not cache resources requested via <span class="caps">HTTPS</span>.  This leads to very noticeable performance issues&#8212;the kind your users complain about (and rightly so).</p>
<p>It turns out this problem is even worse than I previously realized.  According to <a href="http://www.die.net/musings/page_load_time/">this page</a> (which I found out about in the patch I&#8217;ll mention in the next paragraph), most browsers impose a limit on how many connections can be made to a single named host at any given time.  And on the internet&#8217;s most popular browser, this number is a whopping <em>two</em>.  Add to this the fact that <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/http/pipelining-faq.html"><span class="caps">HTTP</span> Pipelining</a> is disabled by default, and a resource-heavy page is a recipe for a sluggish user experience.</p>
<p>So it was with great interest that I noticed <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6161">this change</a> late last night in Edge Rails.  <a href="http://bitsweat.net/">Jeremy Kemper</a> checked in a new feature allowing Rails developers to configure multiple asset hosts using a numbered naming convention.</p>
<p>As a refresher, the ActionController::Base.asset_host variable tells your Rails application to generate external resources&#8217; links pointing to the host of your choosing.  This is a good way to ensure that your Mongrel or FastCGI process isn&#8217;t being asked to serve static content.</p>
<p>With Jeremy&#8217;s change, you can now do this:</p>
ActionController::Base.asset_host = &#8220;http://assets%d.example.com&#8221;
<p>This tells Rails to generate links to the following four hosts:  assets0.example.com, assets1.example.com, assets2.example.com, and assets3.example.com.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for this technique to be effective, you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to configure four separate machines to respond to these requests.  Simply creating these four <span class="caps">DNS</span> aliases and pointing them at one server will still make a difference, since the browser per-host limitations are per <em>name</em>&#8212;not per IP.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: According to Dan Kubb and <span class="caps">DHH</span>, setting the Cache-Control and/or Expires headers properly on your web server will get around the <span class="caps">SSL</span> caching issue I mentioned above.  Somehow I must have gotten it wrong when I tried on my own.  Thanks for pointing that out, guys!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the first thing you learn when you write your own weblog software and get a decent number of subscribers, is that you need to provide a way for aggregators to tell you which version of a feed they have, so your server can respond by telling the aggregator that it already has the latest version.  Otherwise, you waste a lot of bandwidth sending the same polling client the same data over and over again.</p>
<p>This is commonly handled in the weblog software world with a combination of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.19">ETag header</a>, which allows clients and servers to communicate in terms of a <em>variant</em> of a specific resource and the &#8220;304 Not Modified&#8221; <span class="caps">HTTP</span> response and an empty response body.</p>
<p>This technique isn&#8217;t limited in usefulness to <span class="caps">RSS</span> and Atom feeds.  You could use the same thing with <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">PDF</span>, anything you like.  If the client sends you an ETag and it matches the version you already have, you give it a 304 with an empty response body.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you use a Web framework with a consistent rendering system, you can bake this kind of behavior right into the framework.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, David Heinemeier Hansson <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6158">did just that</a>.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Cool, how do I use it?&#8221;</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Edge Rails, it just happens automatically.</p>
<p>Who knows if this will still be there in a month, but it&#8217;s at worst a cool experiment and at best a nice optimization for all future Rails applications.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: <a href="http://techno-weenie.net/">Rick Olson</a> just pointed out to me that a weblog is not a good Rails-specific example of when this new feature would be useful, since weblogs can usually be cached at the page level (after which real Web servers can just do their thing with the static content).  He is, of course, right.  I didn&#8217;t mean for the weblog example to carry through into what you would use this feature for.  It <em>would</em> be very useful for situations where content is dynamically generated on, say, a per-user or per-account basis&#8212;-like most of the applications most of us make with Rails.</p></div>
