  <div class="entry-content"><p>Within the first couple of days that Kelly and I were in India,  I became painfully aware of the fact that my little job managing a team in India doing IT stuff for back end business processing at a large corporation was relatively meaningless.  Insignificant.</p>
<p>
<p>That was an interesting conclusion to reach.  I&#8217;d gone from being a poor kid who made a meager musician&#8217;s living in Memphis to being a powerful (by Indian standards) executive, running a software center for a fortune 10 company.  I was leader to eventually over two hundred people and had regular dealings with Indian government officials and CEOs of neighboring companies.  Kelly and I lived in a palatial house on a street lined with government leaders for the state of Karnataka.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But every single day, on the way to the office where I would play another game of business Monopoly, we would stop at one of the many beggar-lined red lights in the city where a young girl carrying a dusty, naked baby would come tap on the windows of the car and motion to her mouth.  We would hear the moaning of the lepers on the corners&#8212;-people too sick to stand at the car, so they had to moan to make up for the lack of an attention-getting tapping sound.  People whose limbs were amputated or mutilated and usually covered with bandages.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
It&#8217;s pretty easy to let yourself go numb to this kind of thing.  Especially when you&#8217;re not in a car, and they&#8217;re chasing you down the street and&#8212;-God forbid&#8212;-<em>touching you. </em>You just want to get away.  You just want to go about your business.  The people become pests to you.  An annoying part of the scenery.  An obstacle.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Kelly and I now live in Colorado.  Near Boulder.  We&#8217;re right at the base of the mountains.  When we moved here (a year and a half ago) we said something like this:  &#8220;Do you think people who live here ever get tired of looking at that view?  Do they ever forget how amazing this place is?  I hope we don&#8217;t.  Let&#8217;s not.  Let&#8217;s vow to not get numb to it.&#8221;</p>
<p></p><p><br />
That&#8217;s the same thing you have to do in India with the poverty and the sickness.  You have to resolve not to go numb to it.  Even if you&#8217;re a compassionate person.  Like the mountains in Boulder, the constant landscape on a daily commute in India is decorated with images of poverty and sickness.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
The amazing thing about each one of these beggars you see on the street&#8212;-and there are a <em>lot</em> of them&#8212;-is that I have enough money that, without too much effort I could completely change one of these people&#8217;s lives.  I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m rich.  But in Indian terms I am.  And at this level of the Indian economy, I&#8217;m like a king.  So knowing that, it becomes difficult to buy a computer or a car or a house or a really nice piece of clothing or a big meal without thinking about the difference that money could make in a family&#8217;s life somewhere else in the world.  Even in the US, as it turns out.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Since leaving India, I&#8217;ve changed my focus a bit.  Instead of working within the confines of a single company, I&#8217;ve turned my attention outward.  I&#8217;ve written a couple of books, spoken at quite a few conferences.  Written some open source software.  That kind of thing.  I believe that at least one of my books has had a somewhat profound impact on many of its readers.  This is nice.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
I&#8217;m sure that this change was at least partially inspired by the epiphany of insignificance which came over me on the Indian streets.   But now, several years later, I can look back and see that if I were to idle at one of those street lights now, sitting low in the back seat listening to the tapping, I would realize that my accomplishments still pale in the harsh light of reality.  What I&#8217;m doing now matters more than what I was doing then in the same way that eating 95% of a cheeseburger will make you less fat than eating the whole thing.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
We in the Ruby on Rails community like to get gung ho about being on the leading edge of change.  We even like to say the phrase <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ruby+on+rails+%22changing+the+world%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">&#8220;change the world&#8221;</a>  in reference to the things we&#8217;re doing with the framework and the applications we&#8217;re building with it.  It&#8217;s not just us tooting our own horns either.  Business 2.0 named David Heinemeier Hansson one of their top 50 people &#8220;who matter now&#8221; last spring, citing world-changing ideas as a major criterion for inclusion.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
It&#8217;s fun and feels good to think of yourself as a world changer.  But every time I hear the phrase, I think about those street corners and back alleys, and I feel a little cheap.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
The easiest way to really change the world is to find a charity you believe in and start sending some money.  We Americans have a lot of extra money, so it&#8217;s not too hard.  In fact, I think it&#8217;s too easy.  I&#8217;m not saying we shouldn&#8217;t do it, but that at least for me, financial contributions are so easy and faceless that I will forget about them.  They also have very limited impact.  Even if I were to donate 10% of my annual income, the net possible impact is limited to that amount of money.  That&#8217;ll help an organization toward its goals, but I think I have a lot more to offer.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
The real treasure I have to offer is my passion.  I almost said &#8220;my time&#8221;, but I&#8217;m not talking about picking up garbage on the side of the road for an hour a week.  I&#8217;m talking about &#8220;flow time&#8221;.  Passion-infused time that grows into the evenings and early mornings because I&#8217;m on a roll and I just can&#8217;t stop.  I&#8217;ve been known to do some really smart stuff when I&#8217;m in that kind of mode.  And, of course, when I say &#8220;I&#8221;, I mean me and my friends and family.  The people I know.  You too (if you&#8217;re not already in that group).  We&#8217;re all capable of actually changing things if we dedicate ourselves to really changing things.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Back to this Rails thing again.  If you really can develop applications ten times faster with Rails than with other technologies, and you really can develop them so fast that throw-away applications are even OK (you can), Rails itself makes for an excellent tool to facilitate real change.  The scope is limited, but where people have brilliant ideas that involve making a positive difference to the world using web applications, passionate Rails developers can get them to their goals faster than ever before.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
I have some specific ideas about how I can start at least trying to make a real difference using my skill set (programming&#8212;-these days in Ruby/Rails).  They&#8217;re half-baked so I&#8217;ll go into them a different day.  But&#8230;</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Instead of being a community known for being arrogant and self-congratulatory, imagine if we took this energy, passion, and (at the risk of sounding arrogant) <em>raw badassedness</em> and <em>actually started changing the world?</em>   <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/02/02">The Rails Guidebook</a> was an excellent start, but it wasn&#8217;t as infectious as we might have hoped.  If we can manage to easily raise <a href="http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2006/8/4/the-caboose-rails-documentation-project">thousands of dollars</a> to write documentation for Rails or to have a designer create a logo, surely we can turn this machine toward some tangibly world-beneficial cause.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
What next?</p></p></div>

<p>Fabio has an excellent interview style.  I really enjoyed it and I think it came out really well.  Fabio has been doing a ton of other interview lately in an effort to shine a light on Rails in Brazil.

<p>We&#8217;re going to be able to fit a few more people in this year, but it&#8217;s impossible to know how Ruby&#8217;s continued growth will affect attendance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What do you have cooking on your Rails project? The community wants to know!</p>
<p><img src="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/images/fr_arr_medium.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>When the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/index.html">first Rails Recipes book</a> was written, most of the Rails knowledge was concentrated in a small group of experts. These days, with new Rails applications being launched almost weekly and so many different problems being solved, the State of the Art is more evenly spread across the community. In order to capture what&#8217;s happening in the Rails community, we&#8217;d like the second Rails Recipe book to incorporate advanced recipes from the community&#8217;s best and brightest.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s your chance to share tasty dishes that others may have never imagined they could make. We (<a href="http://clarkware.com">Mike</a> and <a href="http://chadfowler.com">Chad</a>) will help you prepare your recipe for inclusion in the upcoming <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_arr/index.html">Advanced Rails Recipes</a> book, including reviewing and testing the code, and you&#8217;ll get all the credit.</p>
<p>To propose a recipe idea, here&#8217;s all we need from you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A paragraph or two describing the problem that the recipe solves</li>
	<li>A sentence or two indicating what the solution will be</li>
	<li>You should already have working code. You can send some along if it helps convey your idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Email your idea to us at railsrecipes@gmail.com by May 25th (but if you&#8217;ve already got an idea in mind, go ahead and send it today!). We&#8217;ll review your idea and let you know by May 31st if we can fit it in the book. After that, we&#8217;ll start working together to get your recipe into the book!</p>
<p>If your recipe is selected, your name, bio, and link to your site/blog will appear in the book. And you&#8217;ll receive a complimentary copy of the book, of course.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starbucks has forcefully(*) created its own little flavor of the English you use when ordering coffee.  Somehow &#8220;tall&#8221; means &#8220;small&#8221;.   Instead of medium, you order a &#8220;grande&#8221;.  Then there&#8217;s &#8220;room&#8221; and &#8220;drip&#8221;&#8212;-neither of which mean anything to me as a fairly enthusiastic coffee drinker.</p>
<p>High resolution experience.  Specialized language is a good sign according to people like Kathy, etc.</p>
<p>But is it actually about the users?  I don&#8217;t know many users who like it.  Some are intimidated.  More are disgusted.  Some (like me) got tired of hearing Starbucks employees correct them(*) and now guiltily find themselves saying &#8220;grande&#8221; when they mean &#8220;medium&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a customer, none of this makes me feel like &#8220;I rule&#8221;.  It makes me feel stupid and, because I&#8217;ve bent to the ridiculous language, it makes me feel cheap.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, I&#8217;m finding more frequently than not, that Starbucks employees uniformly mispronounce their own ridiculous names for things.  Particularly, it&#8217;s &#8220;venti&#8221; (ven-tee), not ventay.  But they all say ventay.</p>
<p>http://starbucksgossip.typepad.com/<em>/2006/04/yet_another</em>new.html</p>
<ul>
	<li>Yes, &#8220;forcefully&#8221;.  I haven&#8217;t confirmed this, but I&#8217;m pretty certain there&#8217;s some corporate mandate which says that if a customer manages to order a beverage without using the Starbucks terminology, the employee must rudely repeat the order back in Starbucks-speak.  Enough times and customers will bend to the company&#8217;s will.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Running a nonprofit is hard work.  But it&#8217;s all worth it when you get votes of confidence like the following email I received today from <a href="mailto:daneel.olivaw.3000@gmail.com">Mark Morton</a>:</p>
Forgive me if I have contacted the wrong person&#8230;this message is for whoever is running rubycentral.org
(which   is currently down).

You say RubyCentral is a &#8220;a growing web resource for everything to do with the Ruby language&#8221;, yet all I find are
a few tired articles dated from 2000?  Is this the same RubyCentral that is co-sponsoring RubyConf Europe
2007? (I hope not!) Nothing about the conference here?  Your <span class="caps">FAQ</span> link is broken, as is your feedback <span class="caps">SEND</span>
button on the Links page.  Sheesh!

If the above is true, it seems to me that RubyCentral is more of an <em>embarrassment</em> to the Ruby community.
Please get your act together, if only for the sake of the language.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We at <a href="http://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central</a> have been sponsoring a <a href="http://rubycentral.org/news/2006/07/28/ruby-central-announces-regional-conference-grant-program-2006/">regional conference grant program</a> this year.   <a href="http://rubyconfmi.org/">Several</a> <a href="http://mtnwestruby.org/">little</a> <a href="http://www.goruco.com/">ruby conferences</a> have <a href="http://rubyhoedown.com">popped up</a> around the US and abroad.</p>
<p>Having co-organized <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a>, <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a>, and the <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/">European RailsConf</a> since their inceptions, I thought I&#8217;d throw some thoughts into my weblog for the benefit of anyone who might like to put together a small conference.  I like small conferences.</p>
<p>This is a somewhat unstructured (though mostly chronological) brain dump.  If you have additional ideas, please do provide them in the comments or link your own weblog posts here.  I&#8217;m absolutely sure I haven&#8217;t covered everything.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Guess at how many people you can attract.  Guess conservatively.  If you guess too high you&#8217;re going to lose some money.</li>
	<li>Decide how much you would like the conference to cost to attend (the price per ticket).</li>
	<li>Pick a location (city, state, country) based on the first two things.  If you want attendees to pay as little as possible, put it in a cheap enough place.</li>
	<li>Find a venue.  Hopefully you can find one that will cost you little enough that it allows you to charge as little as you&#8217;re hoping with the desired number of attendees.  Otherwise you may have to adjust.  The venue will probably require a deposit.  You might be able to save money by finding a university or somewhere similar which will sponsor and/or host you.</li>
	<li>If you&#8217;re planning a Ruby-related conference, apply for a Ruby Central <a href="http://rubycentral.org/news/2006/07/28/ruby-central-announces-regional-conference-grant-program-2006/">regional conference grant</a>.</li>
	<li>Get someone to make a nice looking web site.  An ugly web site will make a noticeable impact on registrations for a new conference.</li>
	<li>Get someone to design t-shirts, name badges, and/or programs.  Budget for them.  Sites like <a href="http://customink.com">http://customink.com</a> are the best way to go.</li>
	<li>Try to get at least one &#8220;name&#8221; to agree to attend.  Maybe you can get a sponsor to pay to fly someone well-known in.   If you keep it community-oriented you can get someone with a name without having to pay them.  If you can&#8217;t get someone with a name, it&#8217;s not the end of the world, but you&#8217;ll probably have to keep the estimated numbers small as a result.</li>
	<li>Announce the conference with the name of the well-known speaker.  Generate a little buzz and lay out a schedule (Call For Proposals (<span class="caps">CFP</span>) happens on this date, speakers announced on this date, registration on this date, conference on this date, etc.)</li>
	<li>Write a good <span class="caps">CFP</span>.  Describe what you&#8217;re looking for in talks, the motivation for the conference, etc.</li>
	<li>Send out the <span class="caps">CFP</span>.  Try to get it on Ruby web sites and all the appropriate mailing lists.  Get people you know to blog it, etc.  You&#8217;ll probably need some kind of system for accepting the proposals as well.  Make sure you collect speaker bio, photos, and abstracts while the proposals are being collected.  Otherwise you&#8217;ll never be able to get all of them later when you need them.</li>
	<li>Get some notable community members to help you vote on the proposals.  At least one.  Announce this person or persons on your site as being in the program committee.  This&#8217;ll help build credibility.  Perhaps you should actually do this before you announce the conference, so it&#8217;s all part of the initial package.</li>
	<li>Notify all of the accepted speakers.  Get them to confirm that they&#8217;re still on for the conference, so you don&#8217;t end up with last minute slots to fill due to speakers backing out.</li>
	<li>Assume that, despite the efforts of the previous step, you&#8217;re going to have last-minute slots to fill.  Find a volunteer or volunteers who can be ready with a talk in case you need it.</li>
	<li>Announce the program.  Make it as detailed as you can.  Don&#8217;t skimp here.  It helps with registration.</li>
	<li>Get someone to make some nice &#8220;Speaking at Blah&#8221; badges for the speakers to put on their web sites.</li>
	<li>Get someone to make some nice &#8220;Attending Blah&#8221; badges for the attendees who&#8217;ve registered to put on their web sites.</li>
	<li>Figure out how you&#8217;re going to accept registrations.  In my experience, accepting credit cards (and <span class="caps">NOT</span> checks) is a really good plan.  It&#8217;s hard to deal with checks.  People end up not paying or just not showing up at all.  That costs you money if it seriously screws with your budget.  There are services you can use to do this.  Acteva, Regonline, etc.</li>
	<li>Open registration in a flurry of spam, blog posts, and public demonstrations.</li>
	<li>Plan to do something like serial interviews, articles, etc. with and/or by your speakers.  This will help get the word out while actually creating something of value for the community on the net.</li>
	<li>Sell out the conference (or at least sell enough that you don&#8217;t lose money from it (unless that&#8217;s OK with you)).</li>
	<li>Stay in touch with the venue.  For the conference, you&#8217;ll need to worry about seating (classroom seating is the best), projectors, screens, sound (probably best to have a clip-on microphone as well as a wireless hand-held for audience questions), and power (attendees will want to plug their laptops in&#8212;-you need power strips and extension cords).</li>
	<li>You may want to audio- or video-record the conference sessions.  Plan early.  Ask speakers if it&#8217;s OK.  Create and get them to sign a release, allowing you to record and post their talks.</li>
	<li>Put together and mail out logistics info for both speakers and attendees.  Be explicit about where they should stay, when they should come, who pays for what, etc.  It&#8217;s good to get this all done before anyone shows up.</li>
	<li>Print name badges, t-shirts, etc.  Print some blank name badges to adjust for mistakes you might have made (or at-door registration if you&#8217;re allowing that).  Also print programs.  People like to have the paper.</li>
	<li>Get to the conference early.  Check the screen, projector, sound, etc.</li>
	<li>Get volunteers for the first day of the conference.  You&#8217;ll need someone to stand at a registration desk, giving out name tags, t-shirts, programs, etc.  Someone else (probably you) will need to be available for fire fighting.  This is everything from getting the venue to refill the coffee to dealing with attendees who have erroneously been given parking tickets.</li>
	<li>Before the talks start, establish a protocol for helping your speakers stay on time.  In general, speakers think they don&#8217;t have enough material to fill the available time.  In general, speakers have way too much material to fill the available time.  Make sure they know how much time they have for their slot, bring a large digital clock to place on the podium or table so they can see it, and establish a person whose job is to communicate the remaining time to the speaker.</li>
	<li>Schedule slack in between the talks.  Plan for short breaks between every talk.  You may need to eat some of this time if the program runs over schedule (which is likely to happen).</li>
	<li>Make meal breaks longer than you think they need to be.</li>
	<li>Plan some gap times for attendees to chat.  They really like that.  Don&#8217;t feel like you have to fill every hour of the day with speakers lecturing.</li>
	<li>Plan an introduction during which you go through logistics (restating the schedule, pointing out restrooms, instructions for how to use the network if there is one, how to find out where to eat, etc.).</li>
	<li>Have the bios of your speakers during the event.  Introduce each speaker, so the speaker doesn&#8217;t have to wrestle post-break attention from the audience.  When trying to focus on the real topic of a presentation, the speakers should not have to think about asking people to sit down and be quiet.  Ideally, every talk starts with a welcoming round of applause from the audience.  It&#8217;s your job as organizer to make this happen.</li>
	<li>Have someone coordinate with the speakers to collect and post their presentation files (if they agree).  When these materials (and perhaps audio and/or video) are posted, announce them publicly.  If you&#8217;re going to do the conference again, you&#8217;ll want people who <em>weren&#8217;t</em> there to read about what happened and wish they had gone.</li>
	<li>During the event, take lots of photos and ask attendees to do the same.  Establish a flickr tag to use when posting pictures as well as weblog entries.  Before the conference, set up a way to syndicate these things onto your conference web site (or at least link to them).  Highlight live weblogging during the conference both online (your web site) and via announcing highlights and encouraging it during the conference.</li>
	<li>Create some mechanism for collecting feedback.  A simple paper survey works or you could build a small Web app.  Collect feedback <em>at</em> the event.  Afterward is too late.  People won&#8217;t give feedback if you wait too long, and their impressions will be fuzzier after they&#8217;ve gone home and gone back to work.  After the conference, analyze the feedback, summarize it and file away a plan for what you&#8217;re going to change next time.  If you don&#8217;t file it away, you&#8217;ll forget.</li>
	<li>After the conference, link to any and all conference reviews or writeups that you can find.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone&#8217;s favorite TV nerd, <a href="http://leoville.vox.com/library/post/tumbl%C3%A9o.html">Leo Laporte</a> has a <a href="http://tumbleo.com">tumblelog</a>.</p>
<p>As a Leo fan myself, I was excited to see that he pointed to our humble tumblelog, <a href="http://project.ioni.st/">project.ioni.st</a>.  Welcome to the wonderful world of tumblelogging, Leo.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even cooler is that Leo is doing his tumblelogging via a new service called <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>.  Tumblr is apparently <a href="http://tumblr.com/faqs">also inspired by</a> project.ioni.st.</p>
<p>Tumblr just may get a lot of people to finally get going with a tumblelog.  Just today, <a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com">Pat Eyler</a> start his own for <a href="http://on-ruby.tumblr.com/">On Ruby</a>, which is sure to be a source of interesting Ruby info.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These days, with all the buzz around rich browser-based client development, our applications are more and more likely to include a large number of external resources.  <a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/">Beautiful little icons</a>, JavaScript <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">infrastructure</a> and <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">effects</a> libraries, and external <span class="caps">CSS</span> files add up quickly.  As soon as you add a line such as:</p>
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %&gt;
<p>to your Rails application (never mind whether this practice is optimal&#8212;it&#8217;s pervasive), the browser has to download several separate files to completely load a single page.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty far to the left on the premature optimization continuum, so I wouldn&#8217;t worry about this kind of thing unless it were a problem.  It turns out it really <em>is</em> a problem.  Especially if your application is being accessed via <span class="caps">HTTPS</span>.  Not only does <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> add the overhead of encryption and encryption to your request, but browsers will not cache resources requested via <span class="caps">HTTPS</span>.  This leads to very noticeable performance issues&#8212;the kind your users complain about (and rightly so).</p>
<p>It turns out this problem is even worse than I previously realized.  According to <a href="http://www.die.net/musings/page_load_time/">this page</a> (which I found out about in the patch I&#8217;ll mention in the next paragraph), most browsers impose a limit on how many connections can be made to a single named host at any given time.  And on the internet&#8217;s most popular browser, this number is a whopping <em>two</em>.  Add to this the fact that <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/http/pipelining-faq.html"><span class="caps">HTTP</span> Pipelining</a> is disabled by default, and a resource-heavy page is a recipe for a sluggish user experience.</p>
<p>So it was with great interest that I noticed <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6161">this change</a> late last night in Edge Rails.  <a href="http://bitsweat.net/">Jeremy Kemper</a> checked in a new feature allowing Rails developers to configure multiple asset hosts using a numbered naming convention.</p>
<p>As a refresher, the ActionController::Base.asset_host variable tells your Rails application to generate external resources&#8217; links pointing to the host of your choosing.  This is a good way to ensure that your Mongrel or FastCGI process isn&#8217;t being asked to serve static content.</p>
<p>With Jeremy&#8217;s change, you can now do this:</p>
ActionController::Base.asset_host = &#8220;http://assets%d.example.com&#8221;
<p>This tells Rails to generate links to the following four hosts:  assets0.example.com, assets1.example.com, assets2.example.com, and assets3.example.com.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for this technique to be effective, you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to configure four separate machines to respond to these requests.  Simply creating these four <span class="caps">DNS</span> aliases and pointing them at one server will still make a difference, since the browser per-host limitations are per <em>name</em>&#8212;not per IP.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: According to Dan Kubb and <span class="caps">DHH</span>, setting the Cache-Control and/or Expires headers properly on your web server will get around the <span class="caps">SSL</span> caching issue I mentioned above.  Somehow I must have gotten it wrong when I tried on my own.  Thanks for pointing that out, guys!</p></div>
