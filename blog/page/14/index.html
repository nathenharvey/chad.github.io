  <div class="entry-content"><p>Early in my career, I worked as a computer support person in the IT department of a state university.  There was a batch of us that came in at the same time.  We all started at the help desk, worked our way into doing service calls around campus, and eventually graduated to back-room system administration or programming.</p>
<p>After you graduated into the back room, the next step was to get a <em>real</em> job.  I mean, the university job was fun, but the pay wasn&#8217;t so great.  Especially if you started as a help desk person.  Minimum wage is a bad starting point to get increments from as a computer professional.  So, for that reason, back in the back room it was pretty common to hear colleagues on phone interviews.</p>
<p>A close friend of mine had a particularly funny interview that a few of us heard his end of.  It went something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t used Windows NT <em>Advanced</em> Server, because there&#8217;s no such thing.  I&#8217;ve done <em>advanced things</em> with NT Server.&#8221;  He said it snottily.  Still sore from sitting at the help desk helping users with their &#8220;<span class="caps">FTP</span>&#8221; problems, he found it difficult to hide his distaste for ignorance.  The problem is, there actually <em>was</em> such a thing as Windows NT Advanced Server.  He just hadn&#8217;t heard of it.  Before he finished the interview, another friend went into his cubicle, retrieved a copy of Windows NT Advanced Server, and place it on his desk.</p>
<p>This brings us to the point of this post.  Yesterday, registration for Pragmatic Studio&#8217;s March <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/railsadvanced/index.html">Advanced Rails Studio</a> in Chicago has opened.  So far this year, we&#8217;ve only got one of these on the schedule, and they tend to sell out fast.  Mike, Dave, and I are proud of what we&#8217;ve put together for this class.  We did the first one back in the fall and got great reviews from the attendees.  It was a joy to teach and (we think) a joy to attend.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, being pretty close to what&#8217;s happening in the Rails world, I can confidently tell you that there&#8217;s no such product or piece of software as &#8220;Advanced Rails&#8221;.  But we&#8217;ve done <em>advanced things</em> with Rails, and we&#8217;re going to show you how. :)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the first <a href="http://therailsedge.com">Rails Edge conference</a>, <a href="http://onestepback.org">Jim<br />
Weirich</a>, <a href="http://codefluency.com">Bruce Williams</a>, and I were chatting about how to improve the<br />
<a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> platform-specific behavior, when we realized that it would be<br />
really helpful to have more info about the install footprint of the<br />
Ruby community at large.</p>
<p>So instead of going right into hacking RubyGems as was our plan, we<br />
created a little census tool and an accompanying web site to help us<br />
collect information.  Most of the info we collect is from<br />
Config::<span class="caps">CONFIG</span>, with the addition of the RubyGems version.</p>
<p>We know this information will help the implementers of RubyGems, and<br />
we hope it will also help Ruby implementers and library developers as<br />
well.</p>
<p>To install:</p>
<p>$ sudo gem install tattle</p>
<p>To submit your info:</p>
<p>$ tattle</p>
<p>If you want to see what would be posted before posting, you can do:</p>
<p>$ tattle report</p>
<p>The information gets posted to <a href="http://tattle.rubygarden.org">http://tattle.rubygarden.org</a>.  You can<br />
view the posted data with your web browser at that <span class="caps">URL</span>.</p>
<p>As a side note, Eric posted the <a href="http://blog.segment7.net/articles/2007/01/07/rubygems-beta-0-9-0-9">latest RubyGems beta</a> this weekend.  Please do give it a go if you&#8217;re so inclined.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had the privilege of writing a tutorial for <a href="http://dabbledb.com">Dabble DB&#8217;s</a> new <a href="http://dabbledb.com/blog/?p=69">plugin <span class="caps">API</span></a>.  If you haven&#8217;t heard of Dabble DB yet, it&#8217;s one of the few really innovative applications you&#8217;ll find with the &#8220;web 2.0&#8221; label.  For a quick look at what it&#8217;s all about, check out the <a href="http://dabbledb.com/blog/?p=66">popular</a> <a href="http://dabbledb.com/explore/7minutedemo/">7 minute demo movie</a> that <a href="http://smallthought.com/avi/">Avi</a> made.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re not planning to use Dabble DB, I think it&#8217;s worth reading <a href="http://dabbledb.com/help/guides/pluginapi/">the tutorial</a> to see how they&#8217;ve implemented plugins.  It may have been done before, but I haven&#8217;t seen it done like this.  When you host an application on the open internet, how do you allow users to safely &#8220;plug&#8221; their own code into your application?  You could go to a lot of trouble and create a sandboxed interpreted environment inside your application, exposing an <span class="caps">API</span>.  But that&#8217;s really really hard to do.</p>
<p>What Smallthought did might be more aptly called &#8220;plugouts&#8221;.  Instead of just exposing services that you can consume into your own mashup, they allow Dabble DB to call out to custom, internet-accessible services.  And, rather than clutter things up with an ugly <span class="caps">XML</span> <span class="caps">API</span>, they deal in simple <span class="caps">CSV</span> in and out, kind of like <span class="caps">UNIX</span> pipes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens with this both in Dabble DB and other applications that start to adopt this approach.  Immediately after the plugin API&#8217;s release, there are already <a href="http://timcraft.com/2007/7">a couple of publicly available plugins</a> (from an apparent Rubyist.  Hi Tim!)</p>
<p>What other interesting approaches have you seen to accomplish this same goal?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">(This article is part of the <a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2006/12/27/the-big-rewrite">Big Rewrite</a> series.)
<p>While we&#8217;re all in the back creating the next revision of a product, who&#8217;s tending to the day to day issues of the existing product?  Typically, it&#8217;s the domain experts and the original implementers of the product.</p>
<p>Regardless of our intentions, day to day life and in-your-face time-sensitive issues can very easily steal all of the attention from a Big Rewrite.  Screaming customers need their problems solved.  Outages and serious bugs need to be fixed.  Enhancements have to keep rolling in if your project takes as long as projects tend to take.  Somebody has to do these things.  Training new people is hard and doesn&#8217;t seem to make sense.  If we&#8217;re getting rid of a system, why would we train someone how to maintain it?</p>
<p>So, the experts keep the old system running while the new system is being built.  So, who builds the new system?  Not the experts, that&#8217;s who.  Usually, it&#8217;s people like me:  technology experts.  And while we&#8217;re banging away at the existing system&#8217;s UI, trying to figure out what needs to be coded, the domain experts are doing their jobs.  Unfortunately, this means the domain experts aren&#8217;t watching the Big Rewrite very closely.  Regardless of how good the team, if communication is impaired between the domain experts and the technology experts, things are going to move slowly, and wrong software is going to be created.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">(This article is part of the <a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2006/12/27/the-big-rewrite">Big Rewrite</a> series.)
<p>To add to the stress of the <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2007/1/3/justifications-and-lies">Big Bang</a> comes another, mostly people-related issue.  Almost all technology rewrites are driven by some technologist.  Behind almost every technologist pushing for a Big Rewrite is a business person saying &#8220;But, why?&#8221;  The question is valid.  The product already works.  It&#8217;s successful enough to even consider re-plumbing it, so we must have already gotten something right, no?</p>
<p>So, then come the justifications.  They start with the real reasons the software is being rewritten (but usually censored to avoid the technologist looking like he or she screwed up big time on the initial development of the product).  The system will be more maintainable.  It will be easier to add features.  &#8220;Oh yea?  So we can do more features faster?&#8221;  &#8220;Uh, yea.&#8221;  &#8220;How much faster?&#8221;  And so on.</p>
<p>As those discussions get heated and prove unsatisfactory, the list of promises gets longer.  The system will be more scalable.  System response time will improve for our customers.  We will have greater uptime.  And so on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rare, in fact, that a technology rewrite can deliver on all these fronts.  A J2EE Web application may not prove in practice to provide higher availability than a mainframe application.  Rails might be a more flexible and productive environment for a developer, but Rails apps slightly underperform equivalent <span class="caps">PHP</span> apps.  So, you don&#8217;t sell Rails as something that will be <em>faster</em> than <span class="caps">PHP</span>.  You sell it as something that is more flexible and maintainable, and will perform reasonably compared to a <span class="caps">PHP</span> application.</p>
<p>The piles of justification lead to piles of additional work and/or piles of mismatched expectations and disappointment after release.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">(This article is part of the <a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2006/12/27/the-big-rewrite">Big Rewrite</a> series.)
<p>When you do a technology rewrite, you want things to be clean.  That&#8217;s usually a major goal in a project like this.  And at the beginning of a Big Rewrite, while you&#8217;re still wide-eyed and hopeful for your application&#8217;s ultra-elegant, scalable, maintainable future, you&#8217;re faced with a question:  Should we deliver the Rewrite incrementally or all in one big release?  Now, imagine your existing infrastructure is a home-grown Oracle Pro*C-based <span class="caps">CGI</span> framework with its own cookie-based authentication mechanism which relies on carnal knowledge of an aging mainframe <span class="caps">ERP</span> system.  Incremental deliveries means making the new technology work within the dirty framework of the old system.  One big release would mean we could just turn off the old system, turn on the new one, and keep our new efforts isolated and pristine.</p>
<p>In most cases, it&#8217;s the Big Bang approach that wins the argument.</p>
<p>Now picture yourself as a developer or project leader nine months into this project.  The old system, still in production, has been patched and enhanced along side the new one as you&#8217;ve been developing it.  You haven&#8217;t had time to keep up with each and every change that took place in the old system.  As a result, on top of behavioral changes, you&#8217;ve got an ever-evolving database schema to port to the new platform.  And the new system&#8217;s wish list has gotten so out of control, that there are major differences between the old and the new.  To top it all off, working from the old system as a specification didn&#8217;t work, and you&#8217;re way behind schedule due to misunderstood requirements and rework.</p>
<p>The table has been set.  The guests are on their third course.  And now you have to come along and replace the table on which they&#8217;re eating without disturbing their meal.</p>
<p>On a big system with a lot of customers, data migration can be a huge problem.  Not only do we have to keep track of what gets migrated when, but we have to actually <em>perform</em> the migration at some point.  The Big Bang sounds like a lovely idea until you get to the actual event, and you realize it&#8217;s kind of like preparing for a world title boxing match when you know it&#8217;s the first and last time you&#8217;ll ever compete.  The processes and software you have to create, the attention you have to pay before you can create an event like this is often as consuming, complex, and potentially disastrous as the system development effort itself.</p>
<p>But by making it a Big Bang release, you&#8217;ve maximized the chances that you&#8217;ll be behind schedule when you get to the end, and you&#8217;ve therefore maximized the chances that you won&#8217;t spend enough time preparing.  This results in a bad time for both you and your customers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, perhaps due to something intrinsic in human nature, this scenario is a cliche for Big Rewrite projects.</p></div>

<p>Imagine going to the hospital for a kidney transplant, and before and during the surgery saying to the surgeon: &#8220;Oh, and while you&#8217;re already in there digging around, I&#8217;ve had some problems with my lungs that could use a little attention.  And, yes, I&#8217;ve been overeating terribly&#8212;-could you do one of those stomach reduction things I hear about?  And on that note, how about a little plastic surgery since we&#8217;ve got the knives out?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is effectively what happens on <a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2006/12/27/the-big-rewrite">The Big Rewrite</a>.  An existing product, no matter how successful, always has a few warts.  The rewrite is seen by many people as the perfect opportunity to shave off the warts.  If we&#8217;re going to do it over again, we might as well do it <em>right</em> this time.</p>
<p>Under the veil of a rewrite, the assumption is that the personality and capabilities of the software aren&#8217;t changing.  So, what might start as just a few little tweaks will usually turn into an unbridled reinvention, with none of the usual checks and balances that go into new product development.  With potentially many stake-holders involved and an uncontrolled process, I&#8217;ve seen little tweaks end up increasing the total effort and feature-set of a Big Rewrite by as much as 100%.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the not-so-interesting-for-you department, I&#8217;m changing quite a few things around here this week:</p>
<p><a href="http://codefluency.com">Bruce Williams</a> has done a stunningly great redesign of this site.  Bruce is the designer for <a href="http://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central</a>, so if you&#8217;ve been to our recent conferences, you probably have one of his t-shirts.</p>
<p>Also, after nearly four years of faithful service, I&#8217;ve retired Dave Thomas&#8217;s <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rublog/">Rublog</a> in favor of Rick Olson&#8217;s <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a>.  If you suddenly see a bunch of my old posts in your news reader, that&#8217;s probably why.</p>
<p>I worked to try to map old URLs to new URLs, but there are bound to be some things broken.  Let me know (my first name @ my domain) if you encounter anything wacky you don&#8217;t think I know about.  Also, I haven&#8217;t yet moved the comments over, so apologies to those who&#8217;ve posted comments lately.  I&#8217;ll try to get them ported over next week.</p></div>
