  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past weekend, I had the privilege of participating in Pragmatic<br />
Studio&#8217;s <a href="http://therailsedge.com">Rails Edge</a> conference.<br />
I haven&#8217;t had this much fun in a <em>long</em> time. It was a<br />
single-track event with a definite who&#8217;s-who <a
href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/speakers.html">speaker<br />
lineup</a> (seriously humbling to be in that list). I learned an incredible<br />
amount from the other speakers&#8217; presentations (not to mention my own,<br />
come to think of it).</p>
<p>
<p>Highlights for me were getting to pick <a
href="http://duncandavidson.com/">James&#8217;s</a> brain about how best to deal<br />
with multiplatform issues in <a href="http://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a>,<br />
learning about Rails internals from <a href="http://vernix.org">Marcel<br />
Molina, Jr.</a> (I don&#8217;t think a presentation went by for the full 3<br />
days without Marcel being asked some hard questions), and spending quality<br />
time with the <a href="http://relevancellc.com/">Relevance</a> guys for the<br />
first time.</p>

</div>
<p>
<p>(Like many of the best photos of Ruby/Rails events, <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com">Dave Thomas</a> took this photo.<br />
Check out his <a
href="http://flickr.com/photos/pragdave/sets/72157594379209598/">photoset</a><br />
of the event. Lots of good ones.)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Overall, this is the event that I think is responsible for fully<br />
rejuvenating me after a short period of burnout. I can feel the wheels<br />
turning again and can&#8217;t <em>wait</em> until the <a
href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/reston.html">next one</a> in<br />
Reston. Being their home town, maybe some of the <a
href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/">folks</a> <a
href="http://tomcopeland.blogs.com/">from</a> <a
href="http://infoether.com/">InfoEther</a> will make it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The conversations on RubyGems and deployment issues spawned a <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/tattle">new project</a> which<br />
we&#8217;re banging away at. Hopefully we&#8217;ll have a release over the<br />
holidays (in between driving, eating too much turkey, etc.)</p>

But the truth of the matter is, as <a

Patrick&#8217;s post, Matz and Koichi are still planning to implement<br />
continuations for Ruby 2.0.</p>
<p>
<p>&quot;If it&#8217;s not too hard&quot;, said Matz over breakfast. Koichi<br />
then nodded quickly and nervously, not looking up from the <span class="caps">YARV</span> source on<br />
his laptop (which was given higher priority real estate on the table than<br />
his breakfast plate).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://headius.com/">Charles</a> says he can do them in JRuby. <a
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott</a> told me he had some ideas<br />
on how to do them on .<span class="caps">NET</span>. My money&#8217;s on Koichi for making it happen.</p>

shipping!</p>

<p>
<p>It&#8217;s always satisfying the first time you get to hold a physical copy<br />
of a book you&#8217;ve slaved over. But as a special treat, this time <a
href="http://pragprog.com">Pragmatic Dave</a> has put together a <a
href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Random/ShippingRecipes.html">slide<br />
show</a> of what it takes to actually ship a book.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Particulary impressive is the fact that Dave seems to have cloned himself<br />
to have more hands on deck during the shipping process. I&#8217;ve always<br />
wondered how he manages to accomplish so much given the same number of<br />
hours available as the rest of us.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a short (but seemingly long) and intense ride, and<br />
I&#8217;m looking forward to a little rest and relaxation. I owe a huge<br />
thanks to everyone who contributed ideas, content, and bug reports.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For those of you who have been trying to decide whether to grab a copy,<br />
here&#8217;s the first part of the book&#8217;s introduction, which will<br />
hopefully give you a better sense of what I was trying to accomplish in the<br />
book:</p>
</p>
<h2>What Makes a Good Recipe Book?</h2>
<pre>
  If I were to buy a real recipe book---you know, a book about cooking
  food---I wouldn't be looking for a book that tells me how to dice vegetables
  or how to use a skillet. I can find that kind of information in an
  overview about cooking.

  A recipe book is about how to make food you might not be able to easily
  figure out how to make on your own. It's about skipping the trial and
  error and jumping straight to a solution that works. Sometimes it's
  even about making food you never imagined you could make.

  If you want to learn how to make great Indian food, you buy a recipe
  book by a great Indian chef and follow his or her directions. You're not
  just buying any old solution. You're buying a solution you can trust to
  be good. That's why famous chefs sell lots and lots of books. People
  want to make food that tastes good, and these chefs know how to make
  (and teach you how to make) food that tastes good.

  Good recipe books do teach you techniques. Sometimes they even teach
  you about new tools. But they teach these skills within the context and
  with the end goal of making something---not just to teach them.

  My goal for Rails Recipes is to teach you how to make great stuff with
  Rails and to do it right on your first try. These recipes and the tech-
  niques herein are extractions from my own work and from the &amp;quot;great
  chefs&amp;quot; of Rails: the Rails core developer team, the leading trainers and
  authors, and the earliest of early adopters.

  I also hope to show you not only how to do things but to explain why
  they work the way they do. After reading through the recipes, you
  should walk away with a new level of Rails understanding to go with a
  huge list of successfully implemented hot new application features.

  Not all of these recipes are long and involved. To spice things up, I've
  included a number of smaller offerings, which I've called snacks. Typically
  one or two pages long, these snacks will help satisfy those cravings
  we all get between meals.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight, I&#8217;m just starting to put the final copy-edits into <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a>. This<br />
means that we&#8217;re only days away from printing and not long from a<br />
real, dead-tree book.</p>
<p>
<p>As I sat in my offices, hotel rooms, living room, and basement cranking out<br />
recipes for the past few months, it never occurred to me that the book<br />
might take on a life of its own. Even before it hit the shelves, as<br />
I&#8217;ve <a
href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/Level1.aspx?pid=10218&sid=3">traveled</a><br />
<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/ruby-on-rails-course">around</a> the <a
href="http://www.scotlandonrails.com/">world</a> I&#8217;ve had the<br />
pleasure of meeting a surprising number of people who have read the book in<br />
<a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/faqs/beta_faq.html">beta</a><br />
form and are already using it daily.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly rewarding to see these things transferred from long<br />
Sundays in the basement to a real developer&#8217;s project in the UK or<br />
China.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What I really didn&#8217;t anticipate, though, was something I ran into<br />
this week. Next week, Peter Marklund is holding a <a
href="http://marklunds.com/articles/one/302">Rails Recipes Meetup</a> in<br />
<em>Stockholm</em>, featuring presentations and discussion based in part on<br />
the book. What a <em>cool</em> idea! It looks like participants will be<br />
presenting either discussions of the recipes from the book or their own<br />
recipes.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Judging by the activity on the <a
href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes">Rails Recipes forum</a>, this<br />
session is bound to turn out some valuable tips. Here&#8217;s hoping<br />
they&#8217;re documented and shared with the rest of us.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As if that wasn&#8217;t cool enough, today <a
href="http://relevancellc.com/">Relevance</a> announced a <a
href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/05/03/rails-recipes-training">training<br />
course</a> based on Rails Recipes. Relevance are Stu Halloway and Justin<br />
Gehtland, two top-notch veteran trainers and speakers, both of whom are<br />
speaking at the <a href="http://railsconf.org">First International Rails<br />
Conference</a> in June and are part of the touring <a
href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ajax/index.html">Pragmatic Studio</a>,<br />
delivering a course on Ajax.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I consider it an honor to have guys like this <em>read</em> the book much<br />
less base a class around it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, before I go back to the copy edits, I wanted to say &quot;thanks<br />
again&quot; to the ever-growing population of super-smart readers that make<br />
staying up late fixing grammar and punctuation mistakes a worthwhile<br />
activity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rails 1.1 introduces greater than <a

enhancements and fixes</a>. Here&#8217;s one of the more obscure ones that<br />
you may not hear about otherwise. I was able to slip a trivial (one line)<br />
patch in just under the wire for Rails 1.1 before it went out yesterday.<br />
Now you can do this:</p>
<pre>
  rake db:fixtures:load FIXTURES=people
</pre>
<p>
<p>or multiple:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  rake db:fixtures:load FIXTURES=people,surveys
</pre>
<p>
<p>Not a big deal for the average Rails developer, but when you&#8217;ve got<br />
150+ models and 6.5MB of fixtures like <a href="http://naviance.com">we<br />
do</a> it makes a big difference.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve just released another <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/index.html">Rails<br />
Recipes</a> beta. This release features contributions from three of the<br />
incredibly talented <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/core">Rails core team<br />
members</a>: <a href="http://techno-weenie.net/">Rick Olson</a> (congrats,<br />
Rick!), <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/">Jamis Buck</a>, and <a
href="http://vernix.org/marcel/">Marcel Molina, Jr.</a>. These guys are not<br />
only gifted programmers but gifted writers and teachers as well.</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s exciting to watch the framework evolve, and writing this book<br />
has given me a chance to witness and document the bleeding edge as it<br />
happens. As a result, I&#8217;ve been able to cover a lot of the features<br />
in the upcoming Rails 1.1 release, for which there really is no other<br />
source of documentation right now.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The <a href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes">forum</a> we <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Ruby/DiscussRailsRecipes.rdoc,v">opened<br />
last week</a> has been a wonderful source of ideas and inspiration. Thanks<br />
a <em>ton</em> to everyone who has signed up and contributed. Specifically<br />
notable are the two recipes <a
href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes/write-your-own">created by<br />
readers</a>:</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://www.apptrain.org/">Mike Blake</a> posted a <a
href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes/write-your-own/post/42">really<br />
useful recipe</a> on backing up your data using <a
href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">Rake</a> and ActiveRecord fixtures.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://sl33p3r.free.fr/blog">Frederick Ros</a> then followed up<br />
with an <a
href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes/write-your-own/post/84">excellent<br />
recipe</a> on using ActiveRecord with legacy databases that have their<br />
<em>own</em> conventions.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As authors for the Ruby community, we&#8217;re blessed with a<br />
super-intelligent audience for our books. No doubt that readers are<br />
learning from <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/index.html">Rails<br />
Recipes</a>, but Rails Recipes is also learning from its readers.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Finally, <span class="caps">CONGRATULATIONS</span> to <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David</a><br />
and <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">Dave and Andy</a> for<br />
<em>cleaning</em> <em>house</em> on the <a
href="http://www.sdmagazine.com/pressroom/jolt_finalists_2006.html">16th<br />
Annual Jolt Awards</a>. The Jolt Awards are kind of like the Grammys or the<br />
Oscars of our industry. Dave and Andy <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/PragmaticJoltAward.rdoc,v">won<br />
once before</a>. Pretty amazing for a young publishing house to win twice<br />
in three years!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To celebrate another beta release of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a><br />
today, we&#8217;ve opened up a <a
href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes">discussion forum</a> (powered<br />
by the wonderful new <a
href="http://home.leetsoft.com/opinion">Opinion</a>) for readers to post<br />
ideas, suggestions, <em>success</em> <em>stories</em> (please!) and even<br />
their own recipes. Thousands of people are reading and using the book to<br />
solve <em>real</em> <em>problems</em>, and we wanted to give them each a<br />
voice.</p>
<p>
<p>There have been so many great recipe suggestions showing up in my inbox<br />
every day, that I didn&#8217;t want to keep them all for myself. A lot of<br />
those suggestions will make it into the book. Others won&#8217;t simply due<br />
to the volume. But the recipe format is obviously resonating with people,<br />
so there&#8217;s no reason we shouldn&#8217;t turn those ideas into helpful<br />
documentation.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>From now on, instead of sending your ideas to me directly, let&#8217;s<br />
start a <a href="http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes">discussion</a><br />
that everyone can benefit from.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Tell everyone:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>What cool stuff you did with the recipes in the book</li>
<li>How you expanded on the ideas presented</li>
<li>Problems you had that you need help with</li>
<li>Problems you had that you can help others with</li>
<li>Or just give us your ideas and suggestions for the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>The book is still in development, so this is a good chance to have an<br />
impact on a book that will shape how the Rails community approaches its<br />
problems from now into the future.</p>
