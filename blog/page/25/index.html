  <div class="entry-content"><p>Richard Monson-Haefel <a
href="http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/1125">writes</a> about how <a
href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> is being proposed as an<br />
&quot;official&quot; language for the <span class="caps">JVM</span>. It would definitely be nice to<br />
have a dynamic language &quot;officially&quot; supported on the <span class="caps">JVM</span> by Sun.<br />
I might even sneak it into a project or two while nobody&#8217;s looking.</p>
<p>
<p>But the thing that really caught my attention was this excerpt from the<br />
&quot;Why Groovy?&quot; rationale, defending its choice over <a
href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a> or <a
href="http://jruby.sf.net">JRuby</a>:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  ..is the best choice because it was built from the ground up for
  the Java Platform and uses syntax that is familiar to Java developers..
</pre>
<p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog">Glenn</a> and I were chatting a<br />
couple of mornings ago about AppleScript and how it&#8217;s said to be<br />
&quot;easy to use&quot;, because it&#8217;s so much like English. The<br />
problem, though, is that it looks like English and feels like English (sort<br />
of), but it&#8217;s <b>not</b> English. My brain wants it to be English and<br />
I end up typing English phrases into the editor that don&#8217;t parse.<br />
Incidentally, as someone who is very familiar with Java, I have the same<br />
problem on occasion with JavaScript (<a
href="http://wiki.codehaus.org/groovy/WhatsWrongWithJavaScript">here&#8217;s<br />
why</a> you should use Groovy instead of JavaScript). It confused me<br />
because it looked like Java, but it wasn&#8217;t Java.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The point of adding Groovy as an &quot;officially&quot; supported language<br />
for the <span class="caps">JVM</span> would be to allow programmers to think and do things<br />
differently than they can with the Java language. If the language is so<br />
semantically different, why struggle to make it syntactically similar? Why<br />
not let a different thing actually <b>look</b> different?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to be uncomfortable on occasion. It shows you that<br />
you&#8217;re growing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since coming back from the MFASoftware program, I&#8217;ve been trying to<br />
stay focused on my remote assignments. I&#8217;ve been doing a<br />
particularily bad job of actually finishing anything, but I <b>have</b><br />
been learning a lot.</p>
<p>
<p>One of my assignments was to read and annotate Guy Steele&#8217;s Lambda<br />
The Ultimate Imperative (<a
href="http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html">library.readscheme.org/page1.html</a>).<br />
I&#8217;ve read the paper twice and opened up an editor to write about it<br />
five or six times. As I read the paper, I knew it was teaching me something<br />
that was going to have a lasting effect, but somehow when I sat to write<br />
about it, the only memories I could summon were the mechanics of Scheme<br />
(which the paper is written in/using).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been learning Scheme in parallel to reading this paper, and<br />
I&#8217;ve definitely felt a lot of &quot;schemisms&quot; snap into place<br />
as I read. But I know that simply learning the language isn&#8217;t what<br />
this paper is about. It&#8217;s just so hard to separate learning the<br />
language from discovering the purity and simplicity of what Steele is<br />
demonstrating. The beauty of Scheme is that there&#8217;s hardly anything<br />
to it. To see Steele effortlessly implement programming constructs on top<br />
of this near-nothingness drives home the power of minimalism.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, now I realise that, above all else, it&#8217;s a fascination with<br />
minimalism that I&#8217;ve brought home from Illinois. <a
href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/avi/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3254253382">Apparently</a>,<br />
I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If minimalism is good, then what&#8217;s the opposite of minimalism?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When I studied music composition with <a
href="http://www.kamranince.com">Kamran_Ince</a>, there was one thing I<br />
always knew he was going to say when I walked into his office with a new<br />
composition. He was going to tell me something like, &quot;You&#8217;ve got<br />
such a great idea here. Why do you have to run away from it so quickly? You<br />
didn&#8217;t develop it. We didn&#8217;t even know it happened!&quot; I<br />
would literally walk in to the beginning of a lesson <tt>knowing</tt> this<br />
was going to happen, and yet it would happen every time. It felt a little<br />
like not being able to spell &quot;<span class="caps">FBI</span>&quot; or like being given the<br />
answers to a test and then failing it anyway.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Though he wasn&#8217;t necessarily trying to encourage me to write music in<br />
the style of a minimalist, the lesson was in fact about minimalism as a<br />
craft element. And, if minimalism is good, then what I was bringing to<br />
Kamran each week was its opposite. Lots of good ideas, jammed into a very<br />
tiny temporal space. The end result was a jumble of intelligent thoughts,<br />
stepping all over each other so that none were ultimately recognizable.<br />
Have you tried to use <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/"><span class="caps">JDNI</span></a>? It was<br />
probably the musical equivalent. In the software world, this has the effect<br />
of both muddying up what is already there, and creating an environment that<br />
is unfriendly to extension and change.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about the thing called &quot;minimalism&quot; in<br />
art-forms other than music. But, in music, one of minimalism&#8217;s key<br />
features is that of emergence. When players are making repetitive and<br />
rhythmic sounds, a la <a href="http://terryriley.com">Terry</a> <a
href="http://terryriley.com/">Reilly</a>, it&#8217;s almost never the<br />
<b>written</b> notes and rhythms that are interesting. It&#8217;s what<br />
happens when they&#8217;re all played together by imperfect humans.<br />
It&#8217;s the slow and subtle phase shifting, and then the<br />
musicians&#8217; subtle reactions to the phase shifting.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Scheme obviously creates an environment that encourages emergent behaviors.<br />
In fact, the whole point of Lambda the Ultimate Imperative (LtUI) is to<br />
show that Scheme can be an imperative language, without changing Scheme and<br />
without &quot;shoe-horning&quot; Scheme to awkwardly meet the imperative<br />
critera. LtUI happens to be written by one of Scheme&#8217;s designers, but<br />
there&#8217;s no reason you or I couldn&#8217;t have written that paper<br />
(other than my age at its time of publication).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, back to Kamran Ince. He was trying to teach me not just to keep my<br />
music simple so I could develop ideas. He was also trying to teach me to<br />
create powerful ideas. You can&#8217;t write music the &quot;Kamran<br />
Way&quot; while making timid gestures. If you&#8217;re going to let it all<br />
hang out with an idea, it better be strong.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>And, with music, I think it&#8217;s a lot more apparent (than in<br />
programming) that you can&#8217;t start with an idea that doesn&#8217;t<br />
provide a platform on which to build a piece. For a patently contrived<br />
example, listen to <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/music/ThatsAllFolks.mp3">this</a>. It would be<br />
possible to build a piece of music on something that sounds so final, but<br />
it would sound strange and intentional. While the temporal element is<br />
missing, an extremely rigid language or an <span class="caps">API</span> that is too large and<br />
complex can produce the same effect of stunted idea growth in software. For<br />
(potentially inflamatory) example, if a method of an object can only accept<br />
parameters of a certain class, my freedoms are extremely and intentionally<br />
limited when using that object.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, &quot;good minimalism&quot; doesn&#8217;t require simply that we<br />
&quot;be minimal&quot;. It requires that we correctly balance substance and<br />
space in a way that encourages evolutionary growth. It is possible to be<br />
minimal and rigid, which will lead to small ideas that can&#8217;t be<br />
developed any further. This is rarely what we want. Minimalism is one of<br />
these words (like &quot;simple&quot;) that sound easy to do but actually<br />
require a lot of practice to get them right.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I see now that Lisp and Scheme aren&#8217;t different because of their<br />
minimal syntax or their dynamism. It&#8217;s the fact that they &quot;get<br />
out of the way&quot;, providing the right balance of mechanism and policy<br />
to allow their users to continue to evolve in the direction that nature<br />
selects, while not being so austere that wheels are necessariliy being<br />
reinvented every day. This is what has drawn me to Ruby (and Smalltalk and<br />
Scheme) and away from the likes of Java and C#. Not dynamic vs. static<br />
typing or compiled vs. interpreted environments.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Many of the arguments for and against these minimal environments seem to<br />
boil down to the Mechanism vs. Policy <a
href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/MechPolicy.rdoc">tradeoff</a>.<br />
But, I&#8217;ll leave that for a later post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dave has posted a clever piece of <a
href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Ruby/LazyType.rdoc">code</a>,<br />
showing how you could do runtime class checking in Ruby (or a Ruby-like<br />
language) by simply wrapping methods and recording the first class that is<br />
used for each method parameter. In his example, he uses it to throw an<br />
error if any subsequent invocation has a parameter of a class different<br />
from the first usage of that parameter. So, the following would fail:</p>
<pre>
  bob.age = 32
  bob.age = Duck.new
</pre>
<p>
<p>Though he warns that this is just a &quot;coffee-break<br />
implementation&quot;, the actual code is remarkably simple as well. I<br />
consider this to be a hallmark of Dave&#8217;s.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As anyone in the dynamic programming languages world knows, &quot;type<br />
checking&quot;(1) is a touchy and usually unproductive subject (<a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Ruby/RubyTypesAndClasses.rdoc,v">RubyTypesAndClasses</a>).<br />
The common complaint is that, without &quot;type&quot; information for<br />
method parameters, code is hard to understand and maintain. I don&#8217;t<br />
generally find this to be true for myself, but I can see and understand<br />
that sometimes it would be helpful to have some hints as to what kinds of<br />
objects a library author passes into certain method calls.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The simplest solution to this&#8212;which wouldn&#8217;t require a<br />
compromise of the design philosophy of the language&#8212;would be for all<br />
library authors to simply document their code, giving their users a hint as<br />
to what each method expects. We&#8217;ve all heard that one before. Even<br />
those of us with the best intentions do, on average, a poor job documenting<br />
our own code. Additionally, what&#8217;s obvious to me may not be obvious<br />
to you. So as a library author, I will probably either overdocument (waste<br />
my own time and clutter the code) or underdocument.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Taking a cue from Dave, I did my own coffee-break implementation(2) of a<br />
hack that would auto-document the class of parameters for a given set of<br />
methods. It&#8217;s implemented as a modification to <a
href="http://rdoc.sf.net">rdoc</a>. The idea is that you can<br />
&quot;instrument&quot; your code temporarily, run through a typical usage<br />
of it, and have Ruby keep track of&#8212;and save&#8212;class information<br />
for the method parameters of specified classes.</p>
</p>
<h2>An example</h2>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a servlet (which I&#8217;ll talk about in more detail in<br />
a later post) that I would like to document via rdoc. Assuming the servlet<br />
is called &quot;ContinuationServlet&quot;, I can auto-generate parameter<br />
class hints for this servlet by adding the following to my code:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  require 'class_hints'
  wrap_methods(ContinuationServlet)
  ...
  (invoke webrick normally here)
  ...
  File.open(&amp;quot;seasidehints.out&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;w&amp;quot;) do |file|
    file.write(Marshal::dump(Kernel::METHOD_PARAM_HINTS))
  end
</pre>
<p>
<p>This will install a wrapper around every method of ContinuationServlet,<br />
which will save class information for each parameter in the nested hash,<br />
Kernel::METHOD_PARAM_HINTS. After having clicked around through the<br />
application with a web browser, we just dump this to disk as a marshalled<br />
Ruby object.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Next, we feed this hash to rdoc when we document:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  rdoc --param-hint-file=seasidehints.out pm_seaside.rb
</pre>
<p>
<p>You can see the output <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/lazyseaside/doc/">here</a>. For the lazy,<br />
documented methods now look something like this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  call_cont([Continuation]cont, [WEBrick::HTTPUtils::FormData]answer)
</pre>
<p>
<p>Full code listing:</p>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<p>Like Dave, I&#8217;m just throwing this up here for comment. I&#8217;m not<br />
sure anyone will find it useful, and the implementation is definitely a<br />
hack. But, it seems like something <ins>like this</ins> might help to quiet some of<br />
the complaints that half the population seems to have about dynamically<br />
typed languages. And, for example, could <a
href="http://freeride.rubyforge.org">FreeRIDE</a> use a trick like this to<br />
provide intellisense-like hints in the <span class="caps">IDE</span>?</p>
</p>
<hr size="2"></hr><p>
<p>(1) The word &quot;type&quot; is frequently misused in the Ruby world to<br />
mean &quot;class&quot;. Matz actually deprecated the #type message on<br />
Object to clarify that a Ruby object&#8217;s &quot;type&quot; is more<br />
focused on its capabilities than its class. Class is little more than a<br />
convenience mechanism.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>(2) It was a pretty long coffee break :)</p>

  Delicious is a social bookmarks manager.

<p>
<p>You can subscribe to my bookmarks and I can subscribe to yours. These are<br />
available via <span class="caps">RSS</span> or <span class="caps">HTML</span>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to mention this for a while, but it hasn&#8217;t<br />
been &quot;officially&quot; public until sometime fairly recently. Joshua<br />
(<a href="http://burri.to/~joshua/">burri.to/~joshua/</a>), who developed<br />
del.icio.us, is also the creator of memepool (<a
href="http://memepool.com/">memepool.com/</a>) and GeoURL (<a
href="http://geourl.org/">geourl.org/</a>).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a similar idea for some time but with some extended<br />
statistical analysis features which Joshua insists would be too difficult<br />
to actually implement if I tried. So, instead I&#8217;ll just start using<br />
his and see where it leads.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s really convenient, in that you can create bookmarks using a<br />
simple del.icio.us bookmarklet.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What&#8217;s going to be more interesting than the basic<br />
functionality&#8212;it&#8217;s a very simple idea really&#8212;is the<br />
network effect of how people, links, and categories&#8217; interactions<br />
emerge into clusters and metatopics.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Also, wouldn&#8217;t you love to have a running list of the stuff your<br />
&quot;heroes&quot; are reading and finding intersting enough to bookmark? I<br />
can think of a handful of software developers whose moves I would love to<br />
track. What are the seeds that are going to grow the next big innovations<br />
or the New Thinking about software development? Perhaps some of them might<br />
show up in these lists.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Of course, as this grows it may become too eclectic for anyone to find<br />
interesting as a flat, running, aggregated list. Somehow this needs to<br />
become &quot;social&quot; at a different level and evolve into communities<br />
(to be fair, Joshua warns on the site, &quot;This system is pre-pre-alpha;<br />
many features have yet to be added. Additionally, many, many bugs remain.<br />
Please be careful.&quot;). Artima (<a
href="http://www.artima.com/buzz/index.jsp">www.artima.com/buzz/index.jsp</a>)<br />
attempts to do this in a very limited way with its &quot;Buzz&quot;<br />
feature. But, with Artima&#8217;s application, you have to choose a single<br />
category that your posts will fit into, and it&#8217;s obviously hard to<br />
find a category that <b>always</b> works.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I wonder if you could apply Vector Space Search (<a
href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/02/19/engine.html">www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/02/19/engine.html</a>)<br />
to this problem to auto-clump bookmarks or people into categories.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>OK. Now go sign up (<a
href="http://del.icio.us/register">del.icio.us/register</a>) at del.icio.us<br />
so I can subscribe to your bookmarks. You can see mine here (<a

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jim has posted a nice series of notes about the goings-on at RubyConf: <a

<p>Ryan Davis has kindly hosted this year&#8217;s presentations (as he did<br />
last year): <a

<p>As usual, the worst thing about RubyConf this year was that it had to end.<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rich (<a
href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether">richkilmer.blogs.com/ether</a>),<br />
Jim (<a href="http://onestepback.org">onestepback.org</a>), and I are<br />
decompressing in the Austin airport, taking advantage of some Wi-fi access<br />
and waiting for our flights. As I warned in a previous post, my posting<br />
during the conference would require some very special planetary alignment.<br />
It didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>
<p>However, I was able to login to irc from Matz&#8217;s keynote to braindump<br />
into the #ruby-lang channel (on freenode.net) about upcoming Ruby language<br />
changes. I won&#8217;t go too much into detail here, but Horacio Lopez (<a
href="http://ruby-es.org">ruby-es.org</a>) reformatted and posted it all on<br />
the Wiki (<a
href="http://rubygarden.org/ruby?Rite">rubygarden.org/ruby?Rite</a>). There<br />
are some fairly major incompatabilities on the way, but overall<br />
they&#8217;re going to make the language just that much better.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The conference, as usual, as a great experience. It&#8217;s great to get<br />
together with that many smart and creative people all at once. This year,<br />
we&#8217;ve done something I&#8217;ve been wanting to do since 2001: We<br />
wrote code. Friday night, during the round table with Matz, David Black (<a
href="http://wobblini.net">wobblini.net</a>) brought up the age-old<br />
question of standardizing ruby package installation procedures. After the<br />
round table, he, Rich, Jim, Paul (<a
href="http://rubystuff.org">rubystuff.org</a>), and I spent the rest of the<br />
weekend crash-coding in whatever free time we could find and creating that<br />
standardized distribution system. It is based on an idea that was<br />
introduced at the first Ruby Conference, and has also adopted that<br />
idea&#8217;s name: RubyGems (<a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems">rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems</a>).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>We must have been quite a spectacle to the hipsters in the hotel bar, with<br />
our laptops and ad-hoc network. We coded long into the night. The end<br />
result is that during today&#8217;s talks, Jim showed how you can create<br />
working Rake (<a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">rake.rubyforge.org</a>)<br />
tasks for creating and installing gems, and Rich actually installed<br />
RubyJDWP as a gem &quot;live on stage&quot; for his RubyJDWP (<a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyjdwp">rubyforge.org/projects/rubyjdwp</a>)<br />
talk. We were also able to get remote installation and dependency<br />
management working (though not perfectly) before we left, including a<br />
&quot;gem server&quot; which you can use to serve ruby packages to others<br />
who have the right client-side tools.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The Ruby community has been talking about this for years. It was nice to<br />
just say, &quot;Let&#8217;s do it <b>now</b>&quot; while we had Matz and a<br />
great core group of Ruby programmers handy to give us requirements, answer<br />
questions, etc. For example, it was really nice when Paul and I had a<br />
problem with Test::Unit to say, &quot;Nathaniel, what does this message<br />
mean?&quot; (Nathaniel wrote Test::Unit).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The only regret I have about RubyConf this year is that it can&#8217;t be<br />
what I do every day.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post some more details on the conference highlights after I get<br />
some real rest (which unfortunately might not be until Wednesday or<br />
Thursday). Excuse any typos and/or incoherencies until then&#8230; ;)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Update: Ryan Davis pointed out that I mispoke (I mentioned I was tired,<br />
right?) when I said that Matz&#8217;s presentation was on future language<br />
changes. He was really looking for feedback on a bunch of high level ideas.<br />
It was more of a brainstorming session than a presentation. This is<br />
important for two reasons. The first is that I don&#8217;t want to mislead<br />
anyone into thinking that Matz&#8217;s presentation represented fully baked<br />
ideas. The second, and more important, is just the very fact that Matz came<br />
to the community and asked for help. That&#8217;s really great if ya ask<br />
me.</p>

<p>
<p>A near flame-war has broken out on ruby-talk (<a
href="http://www.ruby-talk.org">www.ruby-talk.org</a>). But, amidst the<br />
smoldering remains lie some of the most clarifying statements I&#8217;ve<br />
seen about Ruby&#8217;s class/type system.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I have to admit that this thread struck one of my most sensitive nerves in<br />
the Ruby programming world these days: people coming from statically typed<br />
languages trying to force-fit dynamically typed languages into behaving<br />
like their previous languages (e.g. Java, C++, C#). Specifically, new Ruby<br />
programmers are constantly looking for how to &quot;document<br />
interfaces&quot; in some strict, contractual way. That&#8217;s fine with<br />
Java and C#, where it really means something, but in Ruby it&#8217;s<br />
meaningless to check the class of an object on method invocations. What<br />
makes it worse is that they show up crusading to save the &quot;loose<br />
typing&quot; heathens from the damnation that only strict, static typing<br />
can prevent. I probably sparked the initial flame of the near-war, with a<br />
post containing:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  As you can see, any code that that relies on this kind of &amp;quot;type checking&amp;quot;
  in Ruby is naive.  Worse than that, the desire to shoe-horn
  Ruby into Java-like &amp;quot;strictness&amp;quot; can blind the user into missing the
  point, and therefore the full benefit, of what Ruby has to offer.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Rich Kilmer (<a
href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/">richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/</a>)<br />
had the following to say about this static-ish type checking:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  The question is whether you write your methods to expect a certain
  &amp;quot;namespace&amp;quot; (Class/Module), or just simply a set of behaviors.
</pre>
<p>
<p>This is the first time I can remember someone referring to a class or<br />
module in Ruby as a &quot;namespace&quot; for collecting and grouping<br />
behaviors. That one sentence really cuts to the core of the matter. Great<br />
way to look at it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Austin Ziegler (<a href="http://halostatue.ca">halostatue.ca</a>) and David<br />
Black (<a
href="http://rubygarden.org/ruby?DavidBlack">rubygarden.org/ruby?DavidBlack</a>)<br />
joined in with a deluge of great points, with David (who is quickly<br />
becoming the defacto authority on this issue), specifically focusing on the<br />
type != class issue:</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>(excuse this being a little out of context)</p>
</p>
<pre>
  But I will want anonymous types, like:

     c = CGI.new
     c.extend(MyCGIModule)
     def c.another_method; ...; end

  The *class* of c is CGI, and the module/class *ancestry* of c is
  [MyCGIModule,CGI,Object,Kernel] (or something), but the *type* of c,
  Ruby being Ruby, is &amp;quot;the type which is the type of objects which have
  c's type&amp;quot;.  And that's just fine; there's no need for me to have a
  name for the type (since it's not encapsulated anywhere except in the
  interface of c anyway), as long as I design, test, and use c in a
  sensible manner.  I only needed the name of a class to bootstrap the
  object, and the name of a module to modify it.  Then type takes over.
</pre>
<p>
<p>So, to distill all this, Ruby has objects which have behaviors (in the form<br />
of methods). Methods are called via messages sent to objects. As a<br />
convenience, Ruby provides classes and modules as ways of grouping and<br />
categorizing semantically related behaviors.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I understood this topic before today, but as a result of this discussion, I<br />
feel like I understand it in a different and deeper way now.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in object oriented programming, whether<br />
you&#8217;re using a dynamically typed language or not, the thread is<br />
definitely worth a read.</p>
