  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a followup to my <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/LoveItOrLeaveIt.rdoc,v">previous<br />
post</a>, Tim Case has <a
href="http://karmacrash.com/articles/2005/08/24/love-it-or-leave-it-indeed">posted<br />
an inspirational story</a> about having the courage to take control of his<br />
own career as a software developer.</p>
<p>
<p>Frustrated by the software industry and the job market, Tim (like many<br />
software developers, I&#8217;d bet) struggled with whether to find a new<br />
line of work altogether. Here&#8217;s a cliffhanger for you:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  I didn't want to leave because I was learning
  more about software and each new thing I learned made me want to keep
  learning more but I also couldn't keep throwing myself into the winds
  of marketplace expectations.  I gave up on trying to get lucky and find
  that dream job.

  So what did I do?
</pre>
<p>
<p>He took matters into his own hands. Give it a read.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I also stumbled across Kathy Sierra&#8217;s <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/01/you_20.html">You<br />
2.0</a> post on the always thought-provoking <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users">Creating<br />
Passionate Users</a> weblog.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The common theme is that it&#8217;s never too late to take control of your<br />
destiny. Most people just never realize it&#8217;s even <em>possible</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Do you have a similar story? I&#8217;d love to <a
href="mailto:chad+loveitorleaveit@chadfowler.com">hear about it</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in a <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Writing/MyJobWentToIndiaDone.rdoc,v">previous<br />
post</a>, though my goal was to help others, the process of writing <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> has already helped <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>
<p>While living in Bangalore, I saw <a
href="http://www.martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> speak at a<br />
Thoughtworks-sponsored event on agile development. The one thing he said<br />
that has stuck with me since then is that when he wants to learn about<br />
something, he writes about it. It&#8217;s obvious that writing a book or an<br />
essay on a topic would help you learn about it, but it never occurred to me<br />
that these guru-authors might be writing about things that they<br />
didn&#8217;t already know before starting a book or article. Writing is<br />
both a process of documentation <tt>and</tt> discovery.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense when you&#8217;re writing about a technology.<br />
There are bound to be nooks and crannies that you hadn&#8217;t previously<br />
explored, even if you&#8217;re an expert. To present a complete picture,<br />
you&#8217;re going to have to dig into things you hadn&#8217;t previously<br />
had a need for.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What wasn&#8217;t as obvious to me was that the same would be true of<br />
non-tech writing. My book isn&#8217;t a reference manual. It&#8217;s a<br />
collection of bits of advice. It&#8217;s less about knowledge and more<br />
about common sense, good judgement, and wisdom. So the nooks and crannies I<br />
explored as I wrote weren&#8217;t in obscure language features or rarely<br />
touched APIs. They were in concepts that I had either taught myself or had<br />
absorbed through osmosis from the wiser people around me throughout my<br />
career.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>While I was codifying ideas that had been everyday companions to me for<br />
years, they went from being rough and ragged to polished. Not only were<br />
they clearer for my readers (the purpose of the polishing) but they were<br />
actually <em>better</em>. As a result I have produced advice that, at least<br />
on a granular level, is new to me.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So there&#8217;s this one particular section of my book that I learned a<br />
<em>lot</em> from. I&#8217;ve read it many times since it was written, and<br />
I&#8217;ve thought about it even more. It&#8217;s called &quot;Love it or<br />
Leave it&quot;. The premise is that, if you don&#8217;t love what<br />
you&#8217;re doing, you won&#8217;t be <em>great</em> at it. Or to flip it<br />
around, if you love your job, you stand a much greater chance of being<br />
great at it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Stated alone like this, it couldn&#8217;t get any more obvious. But this<br />
book is about making things actionable. I realized as I thought about it<br />
that I was unable to come up with a recent personal example of how<br />
<em>I</em> had taken this most primitive piece of advice and done something<br />
about it. My career had taken a turn that most Americans would consider to<br />
be &quot;success&quot;, and I had let it take me where it wanted. That<br />
meant management in big corporations.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But the undercurrent that was always tugging on me was that I looked at a<br />
lot of my friends in the industry with a feeling of envy. I wished<br />
<em>I</em> could (at least attempt to) innovate all day. I wished<br />
<em>I</em> could write Ruby code full time. I wished <em>I</em> could work<br />
in an environment that was 100% focused on getting things done instead of<br />
drifting in the tides of corporate politics. I wanted to work for a company<br />
that was focused on <em>winning</em> instead of trying not to<br />
<em>lose</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So I decided to take my own advice and find this environment I&#8217;d been<br />
looking for. On the same day that I decided to look, I <a
href="http://naviance.com">found it</a>. <a
href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a> and I are moving to Denver, so<br />
that I can be a full time Ruby (on <a
href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>) developer for Naviance.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Several years in the big corporate world creates a lot of inertia.<br />
It&#8217;s no easy decision to make. But it feels <em>right</em> once<br />
it&#8217;s done, and the interactions I&#8217;ve had with my new team only<br />
serve to reinforce my choice.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The team is going to stay small and focused. We&#8217;re looking for a <a
href="http://www.naviance.com/company/webdes.html">designer with Rails<br />
experience</a>. Might this be the leap you&#8217;ve been waiting to make?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week, I finished making copy edits, and <a
href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave</a> finished the<br />
(beautiful!) layout. <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> is ready to go to the printers!</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/mjwti_medium.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When I started this book, I considered the amount of effort (which I<br />
underestimated, of course) it would take to finish it. I decided that,<br />
given how much of a strain it would be over and above the &quot;day<br />
job&quot;, it wasn&#8217;t likely I would make enough money for it to be<br />
worthwhile. (It was never about that anyway, of course). So, the only way<br />
to make the book worth writing was to create something that could really<br />
<tt>help</tt> people.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Reading through it now, I can confidently say that I have accomplished that<br />
goal. Sure, it seems premature to say, considering the fact that only a<br />
handful of people have read the book. But, what I&#8217;ve found is that it<br />
has already helped <tt>me</tt>. More on that later&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Now&#8217;s when the fun starts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Daniel Berger just released <a
href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/pathname2/">pathname2</a>, a file<br />
path manipulation library that works well on <span class="caps">UNIX</span> or Windows systems<br />
(including <span class="caps">UNC</span> paths).</p>
<p>
<p>Most notable about this from my perspective is that it is 299th unique <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGem</a>. That means there are 299<br />
different pieces of software (not counting their many different versions)<br />
available for installation via the RubyGems system.</p>
</p>
<pre>
        ~/svn/MJWTI/Book chadfowler$ gem list -r|grep &amp;quot;^[a-zA-Z].*)$&amp;quot;|wc -l
        299
        ~/svn/MJWTI/Book chadfowler$
</pre>
<p>
<p>As of this week, not counting downloads of the <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/">Ruby Windows<br />
Installer</a>, the RubyGems framework has been downloaded more than 50,000<br />
times. Within a week, it will have served up <a
href="http://gems.rubyforge.org/stats.html">half a million gems</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, who&#8217;s going to create the 300th gem?</p>

<p>Be sure to watch the <a href="http://onestepback.org/gemwatch.rss">rss<br />

grant</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch an ongoing, quickly moving project like this. As<br />
Tom Copeland mentioned on <a href="http://ruby-talk.org">ruby-talk</a>, you<br />
can see the <span class="caps">CVS</span> age sticking around in minutes (and not hours or days).</p>

<p>When it&#8217;s finished, Gambit looks like it&#8217;s going to be<br />
something fun to play with:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        Gambit is pure Ruby framework for building multiplayer Web games
        offering two key services:  Game management and design tools.  Gambit
        can manage player's accounts, game hosting and joining, player
        histories, in-game communication systems and out-of-game notifications
        for in-game activities.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of our <a

winners</a>, <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/Languages/Ruby/Seattle/">The<br />
Seattle Ruby Brigade</a>, has just finished the first weekend HackFest in<br />
which they will dramatically improve <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a>].</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://zenspider.com">Ryan Davis</a> has the <a
href="http://blog.zenspider.com/archives/2005/05/rubygems_hackfe.html">writeup</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Among other <span class="caps">REALLY</span> nice improvements are some <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rubygems/test/?cvsroot=rubygems">dramatic<br />
refactoring of the way testing is done</a> and a potentially massive<br />
performance <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rubygems/lib/rubygems/specification.rb?cvsroot=rubygems">improvement</a><br />
in one of the core classes of the RubyGems library, affecting not just<br />
install time but <tt>runtime</tt> performance of RubyGems-enabled<br />
applications.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>All this with unit tests. Nice job, Seattle!</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see more of this kind of thing (especially when people<br />
are improving software that I have a hand in). Hey all you other Ruby<br />
groups, it might be too late (this year) for a <a
href="http://rubycentral.org">RubyCentral</a> code fest grant, but<br />
it&#8217;s not too late to organize your own self-funded Hack Fest.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Anyone close enough to Kentucky want to give it a go?</p>

Japanese, I&#8217;m always sure to find pointers to interesting Rubyisms<br />
via The Rubyist.</p>
<p>
<p>This time, they&#8217;ve featured <a

in a multipart article series I&#8217;m writing on <a

<p>
<p>It&#8217;s really cool to see your own words in a language you<br />
(embarrassingly, when you have Japanese heritage, I have to admit)<br />
can&#8217;t even read.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For those English speakers who aren&#8217;t as easily amused as I am,<br />
I&#8217;ve also posted the article <a

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Taking a break from finishing up the first draft of <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">my book</a>,<br />
I noticed today that Tim O&#8217;Reilly <a
href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/05/tech_a_hostile.html">posted<br />
a link</a> to an insightful discussion about today&#8217;s &quot;hostile<br />
tech environment&quot;.</p>
<p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but chime in with a few comments of my own. What<br />
started as a quick paragraph turned into a small essay, so I&#8217;m cross<br />
posting here.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I like the phrase &quot;hostile environment&quot; in this context. The<br />
planet Earth was a hostile environment for dinosaurs before they all died,<br />
too.</p>
</p>
<hr size="1"></hr><p>
<p>These sentiments are remarkably similar to those expressed in my upcoming<br />
<a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">book</a>.<br />
While predators such as <a
href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/lou.dobbs.tonight/">Lou Dobbs</a><br />
feed on the fears of Americans, urging them to blame their companies, their<br />
government, and their offshore competitors&#8212;anyone but<br />
themselves&#8212;as an industry we&#8217;re missing the point. There is no<br />
&quot;bad guy&quot;. Economic forces are changing the face of the software<br />
industry. As programmers, if we continue to fail to hang on to our<br />
traditional jobs, we have no one to blame but ourselves.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Jonathan Shapiro is right to doubt the viability of tariffs and other<br />
government intervention as a &quot;long-haul&quot; solution. His<br />
suggestions are powerful and relevant. However, I find it disturbing that<br />
his solutions center on wide sweeping political and economic change rather<br />
than change from the bottom up.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>His message implies that the changes that need to take place are not things<br />
that each of us can make personally. The only individual course of<br />
<b>action</b> proposed is the formation of unions while we lobby against<br />
the practices of our employers. As he said, it&#8217;s in the<br />
employers&#8217; best interest to hire at the lowest price. Ultimately, is<br />
it not also in the <strong>economy&#8217;s</strong> best interest?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If we&#8217;re in reinvention mode, why not start with ourselves?<br />
&quot;Success&quot; in the software profession can&#8217;t continue to be<br />
defined as it has been in the past. Shapiro&#8217;s message loses<br />
consistency at the end. It&#8217;s as if he&#8217;s urging programmers to<br />
hang on for dear life while the economy sorts itself out. It&#8217;s this<br />
kind of lazy, &quot;Someone else will do it for me&quot; attitude that has<br />
put livelihoods at risk.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>We need to take control of our careers. And, that doesn&#8217;t mean<br />
fighting over pennies and trying to win our old jobs back. If the<br />
&quot;value isn&#8217;t in the software&quot;, then fighting for your old<br />
programmer job is a sure-to-be-bloody battle over an increasingly<br />
insigificant prize.</p>
