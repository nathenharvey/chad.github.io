  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a>, on the weblog for his new<br />
book, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1591841003/002-2313251-5595221">All<br />
Marketers Are Liars</a>, tells a <a
href="http://blog.sethgodin.silkblogs.com/Do-you-have-a-Home-Depot-problem.4222.entry">story</a><br />
that is heavily relevant to software developers today. He talks about how<br />
Home Depot, having conquered the mom and pop hardware shops, has been<br />
struggling to grow.</p>
<p>
<p>The problem, says Seth, is that Home Depot continues to sell a story that<br />
appeals to only a specific worldview: that of Home Depot geeks.</p>
</p>
<pre>
        Many people, though, see nothing but dread here. They see a store
        with no helpful salespeople, a jumble of product, none just quite
        right, a very very long checkout line and fear.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Home Depot, with its tall, garage-like appearance, and its endless piles of<br />
screws and bolts&#8212;all alike, is a nightmarish place for someone like<br />
me. To confirm Seth&#8217;s assertion, when I&#8217;m looking for a light<br />
bulb, there&#8217;s no way in <em>hell</em> I&#8217;m going to go to a Home<br />
Depot for it. I only go there when I absolutely have to.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So how is this relevant for software developers? If you are a software<br />
developer, think about this concept of customer &quot;worldview&quot; and<br />
how it applies to you and your career. Which worldview are you<br />
<em>really</em> selling your story for?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For most of us, it&#8217;s the worldview of a fellow software developer.<br />
But, software developers aren&#8217;t the ones that need our services.<br />
<em>Scared</em> business people do. It&#8217;s the Home Depot problem! We<br />
<a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">lose our<br />
jobs to offshoring</a> or experience salary deflation, and we blame the<br />
<em>customers</em>. How can they send <em>our</em> jobs overseas? Why<br />
don&#8217;t they <em>understand</em> what we&#8217;re worth?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Perhaps they don&#8217;t understand, because you&#8217;re telling them a<br />
story that was meant for other <em>programmers</em> to hear. It may even be<br />
a story, as is the case with me and Home Depot, that is <em>scaring</em><br />
them. This one may have &quot;worked&quot; for years, but you see where<br />
it&#8217;s getting us now. And, as Seth says, yelling the same story louder<br />
isn&#8217;t going to make it stick.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s probably just going to get annoying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> has got to be the<br />
most hyped non-commercial web programming tool in history. A lot of Java<br />
and .<span class="caps">NET</span> people are skeptical. Some are even downright angry.</p>
<p>
<p>If I were them, I would be angry too. You&#8217;ve got people like <a
href="http://blog.curthibbs.us/">Curt</a> running around <a
href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html">preaching</a><br />
about a 10x productivity increase over other web frameworks. And, of<br />
course, <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David</a> receives a great<br />
deal of pleasure in taking pot shots at the poor J2EE and <span class="caps">PHP</span> people (come<br />
on, David, it&#8217;s like taking candy from a baby!). And, to top it all<br />
off, when they pull off the cover of hype, they find that there really<br />
<em>is</em> a productivity increase approaching what might feel like 10&#215;.<br />
<em>Damn</em>!</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The people of the Ruby and Rails community are about to put the<br />
productivity claim to a real test (though most would call it a<br />
demonstration, not a test): <a href="http://railsday.com">Rails Day</a>.<br />
Rails Day is being organized by <a href="http://rufy.com">Lucas Carlson</a><br />
(and others?). On June 4, web developers will have a chance to show just<br />
how much application functionality they can pack into 24 hours of<br />
development. They&#8217;ll be working in teams of no greater than 3 people,<br />
using <span class="caps">ONLY</span> libraries installable via <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a>, competing for a<br />
collection of fabulous prizes. (Not quite as thrilling as, say the Mac<br />
Mini, <a href="http://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central</a> is giving away a<br />
free <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> pass). By the time it would<br />
take a Java team to get their IDEs installed, the contest will be over, and<br />
we&#8217;ll have a set of new web applications that are <em>sure</em> to be<br />
smashing.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, you&#8217;ve got more than a month to prepare. If you don&#8217;t<br />
already know Rails (or even Ruby), it&#8217;s not too late. Believe me: one<br />
month is <em>plenty</em> of time to learn both of them.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Also, remember that you can only use <em>gems</em>, libraries included with<br />
the Ruby distribution, or Rails itself (which is a gem, of course). This<br />
means you can cheat! You have a month to create and release all of the gems<br />
you may need to create the killer web application. A <em>whole</em><br />
<em>month</em>! Go read the <a href="http://www.railsday.com">list of<br />
prizes</a>. Now make some gems! (Never mind the fact that there are already<br />
258 different gems to choose from&#8212;not including the multiple versions<br />
of each&#8212;you&#8217;ll still need more!)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>And, remember: this contest is about fun. Don&#8217;t be too mean to the<br />
Java, .<span class="caps">NET</span>, and <span class="caps">PHP</span> people afterward (I won&#8217;t even mention the Python<br />
and Perl people&#8230;that wouldn&#8217;t be fair). They already feel bad<br />
enough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight, <a href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a> and I are headed<br />
off to Chicago. I&#8217;ll be attending 37 Signals&#8217; <a

Giordano&#8217;s pizza downtown (and then moving to a conference room at a<br />

<p>
<p>It looks like the event is at maximum capacity, whatever that means, but I<br />
bet if you haven&#8217;t gotten your name on the list you could probably<br />
still muscle your way in for some pizza and some chatting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s official: <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">I&#8217;m writing a<br />
book!</a></p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s being published by my friends and (reluctant) mentors, <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/">The Pragmatic Programmers</a>,<br />
which is especially thrilling, considering that they are two of my favorite<br />
authors. Having worked with <a
href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave</a> as an editor<br />
on <a href="http://www.hypermetrics.com/rubyhacker/coralbook/">The Ruby<br />
Way</a> (meaning, Dave was tech-editor and I was contributing author) and<br />
in the same capacity on <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html">Programming<br />
Ruby, 2nd edition</a>, I came into this project with the understanding of<br />
the magic he can work with a little &quot;English refactoring&quot;.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>They also have the most amazing publishing system I could imagine.<br />
It&#8217;s unbelievably motivating to be able to type:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        $ make book.pdf &amp;amp;&amp;amp; open book.pdf
</pre>
<p>
<p>&#8230;and to see a print-ready (sort of) copy of my work in progress.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The name of the book is &quot;My Job Went to India, and All I Got Was This<br />
Lousy Book&quot;. Here&#8217;s a particularly illustrative blurb from the<br />
book&#8217;s web site:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        The American IT job market is slowly coming apart at the seams,
        and it's all our fault. Most of us have been stumbling around
        letting our careers take us where they may, and now we're surprised
        when our companies are shipping our jobs overseas for a fraction of
        the price. It's time to take control of our careers, and in the
        process, learn to stay both relevant and employed. This book will
        show you how to take action to avoid becoming yet another casualty of
        offshoring.
</pre>
<p>
<p>The book is a survival guide for the Western programmer. It lays out a<br />
process, a mindset, and a set of techniques for helping you:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick the right technologies and business domains to &quot;invest&quot; in.</li>
<li>Continually refresh your skills.</li>
<li>Kick ass on the job.</li>
<li>Make sure people know who you are and what you&#8217;re capable of.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>My goal is to help software developers learn how to make<br />
<em>remarkable</em> careers for themselves.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The book is due out around August 1, but I&#8217;ll be finishing a first<br />
draft much earlier. I&#8217;m looking for brutally honest reviewers. Please<br />
<a href="mailto:chad@chadfowler.com?subject=MJWTI-REVIEW">let me know</a><br />
if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
</p>
<hr size="2"></hr><h3>An Aside</h3>
<p>
<p>There are currently 895 people who want to <a
href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/220">write a book</a> on <a
href="http://43things.com">43things.com</a> (not counting the fact that<br />
some may have spelled it &quot;right a book&quot;, and so on :). I am one<br />
of the 895. I&#8217;ve had the urge to write for a long time now. In fact,<br />
publishing a book was in my new year resolutions list at least as far back<br />
as 1999.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As I regurgitated <a
href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/chadfowler/105207">here</a>,<br />
what I think all of us 895 people really want is &quot;to have written a<br />
book&quot;. For me, specifically, the process of writing and being read is<br />
identical to the process I went through when I <a
href="http://www.kamranince.com">studied music composition</a>. I would<br />
spend each week pouring the best of myself into an act of creativity, and<br />
unlike music <em>performance</em>, a composer has the luxury of revision<br />
before showing his or her work. In my paranoia- and anxiety-ridden world,<br />
this luxury translates into the disturbing realization that those who see<br />
my work are <em>aware</em> of the fact that I already had a chance to<br />
improve it. So, I would go into my music composition lessons with a score,<br />
feeling as if I were opening up a horribly personal part of myself for<br />
inspection. &quot;Here&#8217;s the best I&#8217;m capable of. This is<br />
basically &#8216;me&#8217;. Go ahead. Tear it apart.&quot; I have to learn<br />
how to make writing <em>not</em> be like this. It obviously doesn&#8217;t<br />
lead to productivity.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Of course, the music composition story always had a happy ending. And,<br />
despite all the worry, I&#8217;m really pleased with how it&#8217;s turning<br />
out so far. I can&#8217;t wait to hear what you think!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight, I had the pleasure of attending my first Ruby Users&#8217; Group<br />
meeting. I&#8217;ve, of course, been to <a
href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> and <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/"><span class="caps">OSCON</span></a> (the Ruby track<br />
will blow you away this year), but Louisville has had a Ruby Users&#8217;<br />
Group with population 1 since I created <a
href="http://rubygarden.org/ruby?LouisvilleGroup">this sad page</a> on the<br />
Wiki several years ago.</p>
<p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m out in Seattle for work, and <a
href="http://www.zenspider.com">Ryan</a> and <a
href="http://segment7.net/">Eric</a> reminded me that their <a
href="http://www.zenspider.com/seattle.rb">Seattle.rb</a> meeting was going<br />
on. Eric was nice enough to pick me up in his lovely 1978 <a
href="http://segment7.net/images/mercury/passenger-full.jpg">hoss</a> of a<br />
station wagon and take me out to the meeting.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The meeting takes place at <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">The Omni<br />
Group</a>, which has probably the most interesting office I&#8217;ve ever<br />
been to. It looked like a fraternity house for Macintosh programmer geeks.<br />
They apparently have someone that cooks lunch and dinner for them every<br />
day. I&#8217;m probably not supposed to mention that I ate the food there.<br />
It turns out that, despite its horrid appearance, split pea soup<br />
isn&#8217;t bad when served with a biscuit.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>We started with introductions. There was a surprisingly large number of <a
href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazonians</a> present. Apparently, there is<br />
an internal Amazon Ruby mailing list with more members than there are<br />
Rubyists in Louisville.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Topics of discussion were:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://zenspider.com/Languages/Ruby/MetaRuby.html">MetaRuby</a></li>
<li>Seattle.rb&#8217;s Ruby <a
href="http://www.ruby-talk.org/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/133197">CodeFest</a><br />
grant (to improve <a href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a>!)</li>
<li>Pat Eyler&#8217;s new <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/r43">r43</a><br />
library, which provides access to <a
href="http://www.43things.com/people/view/chadfowler">43things&#8217;</a> web<br />
services <span class="caps">API</span></li>
<li>&quot;Advanced Rails&quot; by Eric Hodel (who works on 43Things).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>After the MetaRuby presentation, Ryan set me up with access to their<br />
Perforce repository. MetaRuby is starting to become &quot;real&quot;, with<br />
some really great and <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby2c/">usable stuff</a> already<br />
coming out of the effort. Maybe I can find time to hack up a pure Ruby<br />
implementation of the <tt>Hash</tt> class to help out. The overall effort<br />
is beyond my depth, but it would be fun to contribute to.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>R43 is simple and fun to play with:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        require 'r43'
        connection = R43.new(&amp;quot;yourapikeyfrom43things&amp;quot;)
        chad = connection.get_person(&amp;quot;chadfowler&amp;quot;)
        chad.goals.each do |goal|
                puts &amp;quot;Chad wants to #{goal}&amp;quot;
        end
</pre>
<p>
<p>It was the first time I had met long-time Rubyist, <a
href="http://eldersjournal.blogspot.com/">Pat Eyler</a>, who seems to be<br />
one of the genuinely nicest guys I&#8217;ve met in computer land.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Eric&#8217;s presentation made me realize that I&#8217;ve let many of <a
href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails&#8217;s</a> new features slip by, and<br />
it&#8217;s probably time for a Saturday catch-up session. Maybe after this<br />
month&#8217;s <a
href="http://www.37signals.com/workshop-basecamp.php">Building of<br />
Basecamp</a> workshop in Chicago, I&#8217;ll be inspired to <a
href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/35612">get moving</a> on one of<br />
those long-neglected web projects I&#8217;ve been putting off.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>At some point during the last presentation, Ryan recognized the jet lag<br />
kickin&#8217; in and took me down for a white mocha something-or-other that<br />
he made using the Omni Group&#8217;s espresso machine. Unfortunately,<br />
I&#8217;m still awake at 12:40AM as a result. It was tasty but ineffective<br />
in wiping the zombie-like expression from my face.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Finally, Eric showed me some really cool <a
href="http://povray.org/">Povray</a> stuff he has been doing. Maybe<br />
I&#8217;ll try Povray out again (I&#8217;ve tried and failed to learn how<br />
to use it at least 3 times in the past several years) now that I have an<br />
irc buddy to bounce my ignorance against.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>My ulterior motive for writing this post is to match &quot;Louisville&quot;<br />
and &quot;Ruby&quot; in Google searches. If you&#8217;re in Louisville and<br />
interested in doing some Ruby hacking (or even learning about<br />
Ruby&#8212;I&#8217;ll teach!), <a href="http://ruby.meetup.com/62/">look me<br />
up</a>. The 18-person turn-out at Seattle.rb was inspirational, and it<br />
occurred to me more than it has recently that having a local community of<br />
like-minded developers is a very important part of the learning process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight, <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com">Why</a> posted some lovely<br />
Ruby <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/haikuRb.html">haiku</a>,<br />
which reminded me of a program I&#8217;ve been dreaming of writing for a<br />
few years now. So, I sat down and started it.</p>
<p>
<p>It takes a body of text, and attempts to automatically extract random haiku<br />
from it (&quot;haiku&quot; in this case being mis-defined as any text that<br />
conforms to the 5/7/5 syllable pattern).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I ran it against the raw text of my weblog and generated some really heavy<br />
stuff, man:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  Time is running out.
  If you own a home (or rent?)
  The answer is &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;.

  Climbing on my head!
  Do you have an idea?
  Don't do crack cocaine.

  &amp;quot;weird cryptic syntax&amp;quot;?
  would take a *lot* of practice.
  Don't even
  try it.

  The answer is &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;.
  Code Generation is New?
  (A week late, I know.)
</pre>
<p>
<p>The program uses <a
href="http://www.pressure.to/ruby/">Lingua::EN::Sentence and<br />
Lingua::EN::Syllable</a>, which made it completely trivial to write.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I can imagine, given a sufficiently large body of input text and a <a
href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/LatentSemanticIndexing.rdoc">Latent<br />
Semantic Indexing</a> search engine, you could make some super-cheesey<br />
poetry with it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The code is <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/haiku.rb.html">here</a> if<br />
you&#8217;re interested.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We (<a href="http://rubycentral.org">RubyCentral</a>) are <a
href="http://ruby-talk.org/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/125566">giving<br />
away</a> <span class="caps">FREE</span> <span class="caps">MONEY</span> to Rubyists who have a good idea for a piece of<br />
software and want to get together with like-minded Rubyists to see the idea<br />
through.</p>
<p>
<p>The core of <a href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a> was<br />
created over a weekend, accelerated by the fact that several of us were<br />
programming together. <a href="http://dnssd.rubyforge.org">Ruby <span class="caps">DNSSD</span></a><br />
and Ruby&#8217;s <a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ruby/lib/scanf.rb">scanf</a><br />
were created during similar gatherings.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, now we&#8217;re formalizing the previously informal and giving you <span class="caps">FREE</span><br />
<span class="caps">MONEY</span> to help make it easier.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Are you a Rubyist? Do you have an idea?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Well, then shame on you for not applying. Time is running out.</p>
</p>
<hr size="1"></hr><p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have an idea, here are some things on my own personal<br />
wishlist:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby Subversion bindings</li>
<li>A nice bug tracker in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a></li>
<li>Something that simplifies the open source ruby library release process,<br />
integrating <a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org"><span class="caps">RAA</span></a>, <a
href="http://rubyforge.org">RubyForge</a>, <a
