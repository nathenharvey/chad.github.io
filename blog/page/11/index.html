  <div class="entry-content"><p>RubyConf is going to be held on November 2-4, 2007 in Charlotte, NC, <span class="caps">USA</span>.  This is the international ruby conference.  Matz will be there.  And so on.</p>
<p>The proposal deadline is right around the corner.  This coming Monday at 5PM <span class="caps">EDT</span>.  Some of you have started proposals but never submitted them to get them out of draft state.  Some of you have forgotten about the deadline.  Some of you didn&#8217;t know proposals were open at all.  <a href="http://proposals.rubycentral.org/">Hopefully this will help you to spring into action</a>.</p>
<p>Let us know if you run into any snags with the proposal system.  We&#8217;ve had some email issues that have prevented registration confirmation emails from getting to their intended recipients.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: The deadline has been extended to Wednesday at 5PM.  We didn&#8217;t want the technical issues with the proposal site to get in the way of good proposals being submitted.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> <span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:  I got the deadline wrong here.  I meant to say Thursday. I promise I didn&#8217;t do that on purpose ;)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Friday and Saturday, I attended the first <a href="http://rubyhoedown.com">Ruby Hoedown</a> at RedHat HQ in Raleigh, NC.  The Hoedown was one of many regional Ruby conferences popping up all over the place driven in small part by <a href="http://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central&#8217;s</a> conference grant.  <a href="http://terralien.com/">Nathaniel</a> and <a href="http://www.jeremymcanally.com/">Jeremy</a> did an excellent job putting the conference together.  It was flawlessly executed with an exciting program and a good dose of southern charm.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a braindump:</p>
<h2>Testing Workshop for Charity &#8211; $3200</h2>
<p>The conference pre-started with me, <a href="http://blog.rapidred.com/">Bruce Tate</a>, and <a href="http://marcelmolina.com">Marcel Molina</a> giving a two and a half hour testing workshop for <a href="http://changingthepresent.org/drives/show/241">charity</a>.  Taking a queue from the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com">Dave</a> and <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com">Mike&#8217;s</a> Rails Guidebook, participants gave a donation ($50 recommended) to attend the workshop.  We ultimately raised roughly $3200 for the <a href="http://www.foodbankcenc.org/">Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina</a>.  A large portion of the workshop consisted of me and Marcel interactively improvising the development of an application in test-first style while drawing the questions, comments, and criticism of the audience.  The format worked well (from our perspective), and we covered a lot of great material.  We&#8217;re really looking forward to our <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/cs/railseurope2007/view/e_sess/14736"><span class="caps">FULL</span> <span class="caps">DAY</span> testing workshop for charity</a> at <a href="http://railsconfeurope.com">RailsConf Europe</a> in Berlin next month.  (Next month&#8217;s workshop goes to support Habitat for Humanity.  <a href="http://www.justgive.org/basket?donorId=91403&amp;listTypeId=1&amp;acton=viewList&amp;sess=1">We&#8217;re happily accepting donations regardless of whether you attend.</a>)</p>
<h2>Merb</h2>
<p>The main conference kicked off with a talk from Ezra Zygmuntowicz about <a href="http://merb.rubyforge.org">Merb</a>.  Merb started out as a complement to Rails&#8212;-something you whip out when you need multi-threaded request processing, such as big file uploads and long-running application logic.  Rails isn&#8217;t always well suited to this sort of thing, because Rails is single threaded.  To scale, you have to add more processes, which adds a potentially unhealthy amount of memory overhead.  Merb is a multithreaded, lighter weight Mongrel-bound (for now) framework.</p>
<p>Now, however, Merb is turning into a full-blown Rails clone (Actionpack clone really).  I remain fully skeptical.  I understand Ezra&#8217;s stated reasons for doing it (along with a few implicit ones I think), but I think we already have a Rails, and incremental improvements are, well, incremental.  It would be nice to see someone taking a leap as opposed to a step.  Even before Rails came out, I think the industry had seen enough <span class="caps">MVC</span>.  I am hopeful that some of Ezra&#8217;s improvements make it back into Rails.  His desire to keep things lean and unmagical is commendable.</p>
<h2>Adhearsion</h2>
<p>Next up was <a href="http://jicksta.com/">Jay Phillips</a>, whose <a href="http://adhearsion.com/">Adhearsion</a> framework for <span class="caps">VOIP</span> applications completely blew me away.  Adhearsion is a perfect example of someone taking a powerful domain with a historically ridiculous development model and taking a full evolutionary step forward.  Jay&#8217;s framework takes developers from what literally looks like the dark ages (have you <em>seen</em> an Asterisk dial plan?) to a beautiful and powerful <span class="caps">API</span> with modern automation wrapped around it.</p>
<p>We Rubyists have been looking for another killer app following Rails.  Adhearsion might be it.  Seeing Jay speak made me realize that we have that same combination of disdain with the current state of affairs, courage to slap the (telecom development) industry in the face, intelligence to innovate a solution which brings <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">programmer joy</a> and the people skills and marketing sensibility to push it over the edge.  If you care about Ruby, watch Adhearsion closely.</p>
<h2>The Journey &#8211; Bruce Tate</h2>
<p>The day closed with Bruce Tate giving a keynote on the direction of Ruby.  He drew some interesting parallels to past technologies and also led us through a series of scenarios about where Ruby and its community might be headed.  The most convincing one can be summarized as using Ruby to build elegant APIs on top of existing problems which do for those problems what Rails did for web development.  See Adhearsion.</p>
<h2>Building Games With Ruby</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.chariotsolutions.com/home/index.jsp">Andrea O. K. Wright from Chariot Solutions</a> gave a surprisingly thorough and engaging talk which ended up being a survey of the various game libraries available for Ruby.  I&#8217;m an avid gamer and got interested in computer programming because I wanted to be a game developer, so I&#8217;ve taken this tour myself a few times.  But it&#8217;s been a while and I was simply <em>amazed</em> at how far things have come.  As Andrea spoke, I downloaded literally every library she was discussing and tried them out.  I had some problems with the <span class="caps">SDL</span> bindings on my Mac, but I had instant success with both <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gosu/">Gosu</a> and <a href="http://www.shatteredruby.com/">Shattered Ruby</a>.  I&#8217;m not sure if we&#8217;re ready for Unreal Tournament-style games in Ruby but simple games are finally, well&#8230;simple to create.  Definitely check out Gosu if you even have a passing interest.  Really fun.</p>
<h2>Lightning Talks</h2>
<p>There were a series of quick lightning talks.  They were good, but there were too many to enumerate.  I&#8217;m liking this format more and more every time I experience it.</p>
<h2>Ruby For Change</h2>
<p>During lunch <a href="http://www.casimircreative.com/">Jeff Casimir</a> and I organized a &#8220;BoF&#8221; (I hate that term) on Ruby for Social Change.  Jeff booked the smallest spot, thinking we were going to be a tiny crowd, but we ended up cramming a large group into the room.  The discussion was lively and loud and the people were passionate.  With only 45 minutes to talk, we came out of the meeting with some ideas about organizing volunteers to give their time to produce real applications for non-profits/charities who could use the projects to make impactful change.  More on this soon I hope.  We have a RubyForge project <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyforchange">set up for the group</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this topic and interested in helping to shape what we do, please do drop in and sign up for the mailing list once it&#8217;s activated.  The first order of business (in parallel to doing things like setting up a web site) is to find a project with a real customer to rally around.  If you have ideas, we&#8217;d love to hear them.</p>
<h2>Does Ruby Have a Chasm to Cross?</h2>
<p>I was skeptical because of the title of this talk, but I trusted that <a href="http://www.rolemodelsoft.com/ken_auer">Ken Auer</a> was going to deliver something interesting, and my skepticism turned out to be ill-founded.  Ken is an old Smalltalker and one of the leaders in both the patterns and agile movements.  His talk was a well-thought-out history of Smalltalk and ultimately a comparison to Ruby&#8217;s adoption curve.  I won&#8217;t do this one justice with a summary, but I recommend watching it when the conference videos go live on the <a href="http://confreaks.com">Confreaks</a> web site.</p>
<h2>Using C to Tune Your Ruby (or Rails) Application</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.agileartisans.com/main">Jared Richardson</a> gave a really engaging and fun talk on extending Ruby with C.  It was review for me, but the audience was totally into it, and 2 out of 6 people who Nathaniel asked to tell one thing they were excited about learning at the end of the conferenced cited material from Jared&#8217;s talk.  It&#8217;s easy to forget how elegant and human-friendly Ruby&#8217;s C <span class="caps">API</span> is.  If you&#8217;re the kind of person who has a natural aversion to that kind of thing and have been avoiding it, you really should take a Saturday morning to crack open the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html">Pick Axe</a> and go through some of the C extension examples.  I think you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised.  Lots of potential gain for not much pain.</p>
<h2>What Makes Beautiful Code?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to say much about this, because I hope to take this topic into a separate post, but Marcel&#8217;s ideas from this talk have already changed the way I think about my own code as I write it.  Those that know Marcel and have worked with him know that he is obsessed with keeping code beautiful.  Whether it&#8217;s a shell script, a systems programming task, or a high level <span class="caps">API</span>, he creates some of the most consistently beautiful code you&#8217;ll see in Ruby-land.  In this talk, Marcel decided to take this passion for beauty and try to more clearly define the elements that make code beautiful.  The result is a small but useful framework for measuring trade-offs when developing software.  I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing these ideas develop.  The keynote itself was short but the Q&amp;A and discussion about it expanded such that Nathaniel ultimately had to cut it off.  Obviously a topic that inspired much passion.</p>
<h2>I Am Not A Werewolf</h2>
<p>This time literally.  We took a group to a nearby hotel and played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(game)">Werewolf</a> until around midnight.  If you don&#8217;t know Werewolf, you owe it to yourself to try it.  We played 5 nights straight at <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a> this year, and I feel like some lasting bonds were made with people who I might not have even met otherwise.  I think our community is too cliquey and fragmented sometimes, and Werewolf is a powerful tool (yes I&#8217;m talking about a game and saying &#8220;powerful&#8221;) for changing that.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be trying to put together a game again in a couple of weeks at <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/">The Rails Edge</a> in Chicago.  If you&#8217;re coming to the Rails Edge, read up on the rules before-hand and join in.  If you&#8217;re not yet signed up it&#8217;s not too late.</p>
<p>Thanks to last night&#8217;s players and my (some-of-them) new friends Lyle Johnson, Tony Devlin, Jim Meyers, Chris Redinger, Evan Light, Devin Mullins, Carl Youngblood, Coby Randquist, Joe Martinez, Rick DeNatale, Ted Behling, Ryan Daigle, and Marcel.  I hope to see you guys around soon.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in the South, I highly recommend watching for an announce of the second Ruby Hoedown.  Until then, keep your eyes glued to <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw this while browsing the Merb source code, and despite the bad variable names thought it was pretty nice:</p>
module Enumerable
def injecting(s)
inject(s) do |k, i|
yield(k, i); k

end
end
<p>Use like:</p>
<pre>[&#8216;o&#8217;, &#8216;hai&#8217;, &#8216;rly&#8217;, &#8216;srsly&#8217;].injecting({}) {|accumulator, value| accumulator[value] = value.size}

<p>Simple pleasures.  I find it increasingly hard to live without things like this, Object#returning, and Symbol#to_proc as I start to use them.  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">After all&#8230;</a></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that my domain is alive again (sorry if you tried to send me email within the last week and a half), I wante to quickly mention that <a href="http://blog.rapidred.com/">Bruce Tate</a>, <a href="http://vernix.org">Marcel Molina</a> and I will be doing a charity workshop on Ruby testing techniques at <a href="http://rubyhoedown.com">The Ruby Hoedown</a> in Raleigh, NC.  As was started by the Dave and Mike with <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_sess/12338">The Rails Guidebook</a>, we&#8217;ll be suggesting a small donation ($50) to charity (this time the <a href="http://www.foodbankcenc.org/">Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina</a>).  We&#8217;ve been quiet for a little longer than we should have on this, so please do pop over and <a href="http://changingthepresent.org/drives/show/241">register</a> if you&#8217;re interested in testing in Ruby, helping the hungry, or both.</p>
<p>Note that you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to attend the session to donate.  So if you&#8217;re totally uninterested in testing (shame on you!), a Ruby skeptic, don&#8217;t even know what programming means or don&#8217;t want to travel to Raleigh, feel free to <a href="http://changingthepresent.org/drives/show/241">add some dollars to the cause</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know the presumably Starbucks-born trend of naming drink sizes something that not only makes them sound bigger than they are (we&#8217;ve been doing that in the US for years&#8212;-a &#8220;small&#8221; is called a &#8220;tall&#8221;) but also makes them sound more snooty and pretentious?  It&#8217;s not a medium drink; it&#8217;s a &#8220;grande&#8221;.  Etc.  I&#8217;m sad to find myself numbing to it.  Whenever I used to go to Starbucks, I would forcefully use the English term to describe the size of the drink I wanted.  It would go something like this:  &#8220;I&#8217;d like a small coffee, please.&#8221;  They would repeat back to me, &#8220;A tall coffee.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s Starbucks policy to snootily correct the customers when they use the &#8220;wrong&#8221; word for a size.  For &#8220;normal&#8221; people who haven&#8217;t either been dulled to the silly labels or just aren&#8217;t the Starbucks type, it&#8217;s kind of shocking the first time or two.  You feel like you&#8217;re being very subtly scolded.</p>
<p>You might say that creating a little language around your product is a good thing.  I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s all part of the branding process, and I&#8217;m sure that for the legions of Starbucks faithful, it actually creates a tribe-like feeling of inclusion.  But it still puts me off.</p>
<p>Even as I grow numb to this corporate inanity, though, there&#8217;s one vulture eyed fact that gets under my skin every time I visit a Starbucks.  While Starbucks tries to put on a classy air, they&#8217;re letting a mispronunciation epidemic run rampant through their employee population.</p>
<h1>Venti != <span class="caps">VEN</span>-<span class="caps">TAY</span></h1>
<p>As I steam over this, waiting for my coffee, I sometimes think to myself:  Do we know of any other professions in which the providers of a service behave with snobbish disdain toward their customers while most of them are actually quite ignorant about the very things they are snobbish about?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The weekend before last, I did something I&#8217;ve been hoping to do for literally several years:  I joined <a href="http://infoether.com">InfoEther</a> (as <span class="caps">CTO</span>).  If you&#8217;re outside the Ruby, Flash, or Semantic Web communities, you may not know of InfoEther.  They are a technology company co-founded by my friend and Ruby Central co-conspirator, <a href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/">Rich Kilmer</a>.</p>
<p>InfoEther is best known for doing seemingly impossible technological feats faster than most companies can write a J2EE bug tracker.  They&#8217;ve led the way consistently in Ruby, Flash, and Semantic Web technologies since Rich and Mark founded the company several years ago.</p>
<p>For me, joining InfoEther is probably akin to what joining a company like Google is to many programmers. It&#8217;s like going back to school, in that I&#8217;m joining a small team of people who have all been somehow caught up in Rich&#8217;s special reality distortion field in which no technological problem is difficult or time consuming.  I&#8217;m hoping to catch at least a little of that bug.</p>
<p>Under the umbrella of the <a href="http://site.getindi.com/">indi</a>, a personal semantic web platform, we&#8217;re working on some innovative technologies which bring together much of the diverse and cutting edge stuff InfoEther has been doing over the past 5 years.  More on this later.</p>
<p>A refreshing change of pace from making simple Web applications.</p></div>

<p>&#8230;it&#8217;s bound to be both education <em>and</em> entertaining.</p>
<p>Anyway, the early bird registration ends July 1.  People tend to get distracted during the summer and miss this kind of thing.  <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/register.html">Here&#8217;s registration</a> if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>Seeya there!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi.  I wanted to clear something up.</p>
<p>On the last day of <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a>, it appeared to attendees that Dan Moniz didn&#8217;t show up for his security talk.  It turns out we never actually told him his proposal was accepted.  Our fault.  Please spread the word.  Dan would have loved to speak (he proposed a great looking talk on Rails security).</p>
<p>The attendees of the then-quiet session stepped up and converted it into a lightning talk round (which is cool, because we had hoped to fit one more in).  Hopefully we&#8217;ll see Dan speaking at next year&#8217;s conference.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Within the first couple of days that Kelly and I were in India,  I became painfully aware of the fact that my little job managing a team in India doing IT stuff for back end business processing at a large corporation was relatively meaningless.  Insignificant.</p>
<p>
<p>That was an interesting conclusion to reach.  I&#8217;d gone from being a poor kid who made a meager musician&#8217;s living in Memphis to being a powerful (by Indian standards) executive, running a software center for a fortune 10 company.  I was leader to eventually over two hundred people and had regular dealings with Indian government officials and CEOs of neighboring companies.  Kelly and I lived in a palatial house on a street lined with government leaders for the state of Karnataka.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But every single day, on the way to the office where I would play another game of business Monopoly, we would stop at one of the many beggar-lined red lights in the city where a young girl carrying a dusty, naked baby would come tap on the windows of the car and motion to her mouth.  We would hear the moaning of the lepers on the corners&#8212;-people too sick to stand at the car, so they had to moan to make up for the lack of an attention-getting tapping sound.  People whose limbs were amputated or mutilated and usually covered with bandages.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
It&#8217;s pretty easy to let yourself go numb to this kind of thing.  Especially when you&#8217;re not in a car, and they&#8217;re chasing you down the street and&#8212;-God forbid&#8212;-<em>touching you. </em>You just want to get away.  You just want to go about your business.  The people become pests to you.  An annoying part of the scenery.  An obstacle.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Kelly and I now live in Colorado.  Near Boulder.  We&#8217;re right at the base of the mountains.  When we moved here (a year and a half ago) we said something like this:  &#8220;Do you think people who live here ever get tired of looking at that view?  Do they ever forget how amazing this place is?  I hope we don&#8217;t.  Let&#8217;s not.  Let&#8217;s vow to not get numb to it.&#8221;</p>
<p></p><p><br />
That&#8217;s the same thing you have to do in India with the poverty and the sickness.  You have to resolve not to go numb to it.  Even if you&#8217;re a compassionate person.  Like the mountains in Boulder, the constant landscape on a daily commute in India is decorated with images of poverty and sickness.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
The amazing thing about each one of these beggars you see on the street&#8212;-and there are a <em>lot</em> of them&#8212;-is that I have enough money that, without too much effort I could completely change one of these people&#8217;s lives.  I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m rich.  But in Indian terms I am.  And at this level of the Indian economy, I&#8217;m like a king.  So knowing that, it becomes difficult to buy a computer or a car or a house or a really nice piece of clothing or a big meal without thinking about the difference that money could make in a family&#8217;s life somewhere else in the world.  Even in the US, as it turns out.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Since leaving India, I&#8217;ve changed my focus a bit.  Instead of working within the confines of a single company, I&#8217;ve turned my attention outward.  I&#8217;ve written a couple of books, spoken at quite a few conferences.  Written some open source software.  That kind of thing.  I believe that at least one of my books has had a somewhat profound impact on many of its readers.  This is nice.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
I&#8217;m sure that this change was at least partially inspired by the epiphany of insignificance which came over me on the Indian streets.   But now, several years later, I can look back and see that if I were to idle at one of those street lights now, sitting low in the back seat listening to the tapping, I would realize that my accomplishments still pale in the harsh light of reality.  What I&#8217;m doing now matters more than what I was doing then in the same way that eating 95% of a cheeseburger will make you less fat than eating the whole thing.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
We in the Ruby on Rails community like to get gung ho about being on the leading edge of change.  We even like to say the phrase <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ruby+on+rails+%22changing+the+world%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">&#8220;change the world&#8221;</a>  in reference to the things we&#8217;re doing with the framework and the applications we&#8217;re building with it.  It&#8217;s not just us tooting our own horns either.  Business 2.0 named David Heinemeier Hansson one of their top 50 people &#8220;who matter now&#8221; last spring, citing world-changing ideas as a major criterion for inclusion.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
It&#8217;s fun and feels good to think of yourself as a world changer.  But every time I hear the phrase, I think about those street corners and back alleys, and I feel a little cheap.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
The easiest way to really change the world is to find a charity you believe in and start sending some money.  We Americans have a lot of extra money, so it&#8217;s not too hard.  In fact, I think it&#8217;s too easy.  I&#8217;m not saying we shouldn&#8217;t do it, but that at least for me, financial contributions are so easy and faceless that I will forget about them.  They also have very limited impact.  Even if I were to donate 10% of my annual income, the net possible impact is limited to that amount of money.  That&#8217;ll help an organization toward its goals, but I think I have a lot more to offer.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
The real treasure I have to offer is my passion.  I almost said &#8220;my time&#8221;, but I&#8217;m not talking about picking up garbage on the side of the road for an hour a week.  I&#8217;m talking about &#8220;flow time&#8221;.  Passion-infused time that grows into the evenings and early mornings because I&#8217;m on a roll and I just can&#8217;t stop.  I&#8217;ve been known to do some really smart stuff when I&#8217;m in that kind of mode.  And, of course, when I say &#8220;I&#8221;, I mean me and my friends and family.  The people I know.  You too (if you&#8217;re not already in that group).  We&#8217;re all capable of actually changing things if we dedicate ourselves to really changing things.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Back to this Rails thing again.  If you really can develop applications ten times faster with Rails than with other technologies, and you really can develop them so fast that throw-away applications are even OK (you can), Rails itself makes for an excellent tool to facilitate real change.  The scope is limited, but where people have brilliant ideas that involve making a positive difference to the world using web applications, passionate Rails developers can get them to their goals faster than ever before.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
I have some specific ideas about how I can start at least trying to make a real difference using my skill set (programming&#8212;-these days in Ruby/Rails).  They&#8217;re half-baked so I&#8217;ll go into them a different day.  But&#8230;</p>
<p></p><p><br />
Instead of being a community known for being arrogant and self-congratulatory, imagine if we took this energy, passion, and (at the risk of sounding arrogant) <em>raw badassedness</em> and <em>actually started changing the world?</em>   <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/02/02">The Rails Guidebook</a> was an excellent start, but it wasn&#8217;t as infectious as we might have hoped.  If we can manage to easily raise <a href="http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2006/8/4/the-caboose-rails-documentation-project">thousands of dollars</a> to write documentation for Rails or to have a designer create a logo, surely we can turn this machine toward some tangibly world-beneficial cause.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
What next?</p></p></div>
