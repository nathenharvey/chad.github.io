<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> is only a little over 2 weeks away. Time flies!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a <a href="http://chadfowler.com/rubyconf-speaker-interviews">series of interviews with speakers</a> leading up to the conference.</p>
<p>This time is <a href="http://blog.bleything.net/">Ben Bleything</a>.  Ben is going to be speaking at RubyConf about <a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/83">Ruby and Music</a></p>
<h2>What are you currently doing with Ruby and music?</h2>
<p>This is going to be a recurring theme, so I&#8217;ll get it out of the way<br />
here.  I think of myself more as a toolsmith than an actual creator.<br />
I&#8217;m not doing anything with Ruby and music per se&#8230; I&#8217;m trying to<br />
create tools for other people to use.</p>
<p>My creativity manifests in such a way that I&#8217;m actually pretty bad at<br />
creating &#8220;art&#8221;.  I&#8217;m a semi-failed musician, and I don&#8217;t have any<br />
illusions about programming being the path to making sweet, sweet music.<br />
I just think it&#8217;s an interesting problem to solve.</p>
<p>I have this vision of showing up at RubyConf in 2010 and having people<br />
using the stuff that Giles and Yossef and myself and others create to<br />
make some rad music.</p>
<h2>You spoke about Ruby and electronics last year.  How did you get into electronics?  What got you excited about it?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been into electronics since I was 12 or 13.  I was the kid who<br />
always took stuff apart.  I started frequenting my neighborhood Radio<br />
Shack around 14, building little lighty-uppy things and noisemakers and<br />
the like.  I grew bored of that pretty quickly, but I got back into it<br />
after college around the time that the Arduino came out.</p>
<p>One of the things that draws me to programming in general is the feeling<br />
of empowerment.  It&#8217;s really cool to be able to make a computer do<br />
your nefarious bidding.  Now apply that feeling to a physical device<br />
and you&#8217;re talking about a whole different level of that empowerment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said before that I feel like I was born 40 years too late&#8230; that I<br />
should have been hacking in the &#8216;60s.  Programming for microcontrollers<br />
is, in a lot of ways, as close as I can get to that.  Starting with bare<br />
metal and building an application, even if it&#8217;s as simple as blinking a<br />
light (the hello world of electronics) is deeply satisfying.</p>
<h2>Being into electronics, have you ever tried to build your own electronic instrument or have the computer play a real instrument with motors?</h2>
<p>Not yet, no.  Both are interesting ideas but getting close to requiring<br />
actual musical knowledge, and that&#8217;s where I start to get scared :)</p>
<p>I am playing around with hooking up video game instruments (think Rock<br />
Band and Guitar Hero) to a computer.  This sounds pretty mundane, and I<br />
guess that it is&#8230; but the trick is that I&#8217;ll be passing those through<br />
Ruby in order to provide the instruments with a bit more intelligence.</p>
<p>I guess the bottom line is that I&#8217;m much more interested in building<br />
systems (hardware or software) that more experienced musicians can use<br />
as tools&#8230; which brings us back to the toolsmith point above.</p>
<h2>Can computers generate beautiful music?  Dance beats seem easy. What about jazz improvisations?  Classical music?  Pop songs?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that a computer <strong>can</strong> generate beautiful music, but I think it<br />
would be mostly coincidental.  I&#8217;m still undecided on whether you can<br />
program a computer to <strong>always</strong> generate beautiful music.  It surely<br />
happens by chance sometimes, though.</p>
<p>I suspect that there&#8217;s interesting results waiting down the path of<br />
doing things like markov chaining with music instead of text.  Analyzing<br />
and chaining music is a significantly more complex problem than doing it<br />
with words, but my gut says with the right corpus, you could get some<br />
pretty interesting stuff.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, though, I think music has to have soul to be truly great.<br />
I want everyone to try to prove me wrong, though!</p>
<h2>Ruby, electronics, and music is a lot of ground to cover.  Are you passionate and excited about anything else in particular outside of these?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m passionate and excited about everything that catches my interest,<br />
honestly.  I&#8217;ve just chosen not to focus any energy on anything else<br />
right now.  I want to find ways to share my experience with others&#8230; to<br />
get people excited about doing the things they thought were too hard.</p>
<p>My electronics presentation last year is a prime example of that.  This<br />
stuff isn&#8217;t difficult, it&#8217;s just intimidating.  If I can lower the<br />
barrier to entry, either by educating or providing tools, then I feel<br />
like I&#8217;ve done my job.  I&#8217;m really hoping that my talk this year will do<br />
the same for the people interested in music.</p></div>
