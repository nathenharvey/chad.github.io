<div class="entry-content"><p>In preparation for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a>, I&#8217;m doing a <a href="http://chadfowler.com/rubyconf-speaker-interviews">series of interviews</a> of some of the speakers.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s interview is with <a href="http://terralien.com">Nathaniel Talbott</a>, creator of Ruby&#8217;s built-in Test::Unit framework and long time Rubyist.  At RubyConf, Nathaniel will be presenting <a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/24">Fear of Programming</a>.</p>
<h2>You&#8217;ve spoken at 7 out of 7 RubyConfs and you&#8217;re about to speak at your 8th. I&#8217;ve noticed your topics are veering farther and farther away from programming in Ruby. Is this because you&#8217;re afraid?</h2>
<p>The primary impetus behind my talk this year is my discovery of two things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I get lethargic/depressed/unproductive/unhappy when I&#8217;m not spending<br />
a significant portion of my time creating.</li>
	<li>I often don&#8217;t create because I&#8217;m afraid to start.</li>
</ul>
<p>These realizations grew out of my being the &#8220;business guy&#8221; for<br />
<a href="http://terralien.com/">Terralien</a> for going on three years now, and thus not billing myself<br />
out for development work. While doing sales, marketing, project<br />
management, etc., is creating in some sense, I&#8217;m still a developer at<br />
heart and to create I need to <strong>code</strong>. When I don&#8217;t, everything in my<br />
life (including all the business stuff) suffers. And the primary<br />
hurdle to writing code has been fear.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, yes and no. Yes, a large part of the<br />
reason I&#8217;ve trended away from talking about code has been because fear<br />
kept me from writing code to talk about. No for this year, because<br />
I&#8217;ve written more Ruby in the past year than I have in a while, and<br />
have more to talk about, but I think talking about the fear is more<br />
important this year.</p>
<p>And if one made the assumption there won&#8217;t be any code in my talk,<br />
they might be in for a surprise&#8230;</p>
<h2>At the first Ruby conference, you spoke about Lapidary, which became Test::Unit.  Are you as zealous about testing as you were when you created Lapidary? Why or why not?</h2>
<p>This is actually a big part of my talk, so I don&#8217;t want to give away<br />
too much. Suffice it to say that my perspective on testing has changed<br />
significantly over the past six years, and a lot of that change has to<br />
do with fighting fear.</p>
<h2>How does it feel having your first Ruby project in ruby&#8217;s standard library? As one of the creators of RubyGems, I&#8217;m no stranger to harsh criticism of my Open Source code. Have you encountered a lot of this?  Is it worth it?</h2>
<p>To answer the last question first, it is <strong>very</strong> worth it. I don&#8217;t<br />
think test/unit has drawn the ire that RubyGems has, since a testing<br />
framework doesn&#8217;t have quite the entrenchment that a packaging system<br />
does. This has allowed various competitors and add-ons to spring up,<br />
giving would-be critics an outlet for their &#8220;I could do it better&#8221;<br />
ideas, and the cool thing is that they often <strong>can</strong> do it better and we<br />
all benefit.</p>
<p>As far as getting test/unit in to the standard library, it was great<br />
for me but mostly bad for test/unit. It&#8217;s a big plus to tell potential<br />
clients that you wrote something in the Ruby stdlib, and it does great<br />
things for your Google juice. At the same time, I was already<br />
struggling with motivation and productivity when working on test/unit<br />
at the time, and what I discovered is that getting a library in the<br />
stdlib is a huge demotivator for working on it, at least for me. It<br />
becomes <strong>much</strong> easier to stick with the status quo than to change it.</p>
<p>So if getting &#8220;standardized&#8221; was good for me and bad for test/unit,<br />
how was it for the Ruby community? I think in general it was a good<br />
thing. We needed a testing library in the stdlib, and test/unit might<br />
not be brilliant but it is solid and fairly simple. Having it there<br />
really helped the testing culture in Ruby, and that continues through<br />
today. I like to think that Ruby shipping with testing built-in<br />
influenced David to ship Rails with testing built-in, and I think<br />
that&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
<h2>How can I be more productive? I would love to be one of these people who churns out useful libraries once every few weeks and keeps them maintained.</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll have lots to say about this in my talk, but for now I&#8217;ll give two<br />
conflicting points of advice: first, you have to <em>defocus</em>. There&#8217;s a<br />
real tendency to get tunnel vision about the things we &#8220;need&#8221; and to<br />
stop playing with the things we <strong>want</strong>. Stop worrying about useful and<br />
instead explore fun and interesting.</p>
<p>The second piece of advice is to <em>focus</em>. There are so many projects<br />
and activities that we can spend time on, we have to choose. Review<br />
your list of projects: are they all things you&#8217;re excited about<br />
working on and that you&#8217;re one of the best people to work on? I handed<br />
off maintainer-ship of test/unit for exactly this reason: it was<br />
distracting me from other things I was more passionate about.</p>
<p>Confused and intrigued? Great, now you&#8217;re motivated to come listen to<br />
<a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/24">Fear of Programming</a> at <a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a>!</p>
<h2>What are you passionate about outside of computer programming?</h2>
<p>Well, I have four amazing kids (ages 5, 3, 2 and 1) who I love<br />
watching grow and learn. We&#8217;ll be homeschooling all of them when the<br />
times comes, so I have lots of years of learning with them to look<br />
forward to. I&#8217;m also really passionate about entrepreneurship, and<br />
have a few things cooking in that sphere, not the least of which is<br />
<a href="http://spreedly.com">http://spreedly.com</a>. I also enjoy studying the Bible, and enjoy<br />
teaching at our church every few months. So, life is pretty busy, but<br />
I&#8217;m loving every minute of it!</p></div>
