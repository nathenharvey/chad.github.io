<div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing my series of <a href="http://chadfowler.com/railsconf-speaker-interviews">RailsConf speaker interviews</a>, next up is <a href="http://obiefernandez.com/">Obie Fernandez</a></p>
<p>Obie started and runs the Rails consultancy <a href="http://www.hashrocket.com/">Hashrocket</a> and is the author of the best selling <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-Way-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Ruby/dp/0321445619?&amp;camp=212361&amp;creative=383837&amp;linkCode=wss&amp;tag=obiefernandez-20">The Rails Way</a>.</p>
<p>At RailsConf, Obie will be presenting a <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/7721">Blood, Sweat, and Rails</a>, which if it&#8217;s anything like his talk at last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/2008/7/13/rails-summit-latin-america-2008">Rails Summit Latin America</a> will no doubt be educational, thought provoking and entertaining. It might even include some Def Leppard music if we&#8217;re lucky.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;ve had dreams of starting my own business and doing my own thing. I&#8217;ve learned over time that fear is the biggest thing getting in my way. Is that something you encountered to?  How do you overcome it?</h2>
<p>I started at least half-a-dozen real businesses between the ages of 15<br />
and 21. Those experiences taught me that I didn&#8217;t know enough, either<br />
about business or just in terms of plain ole life experience to<br />
successfully run a business. So I waited, and waited, almost 15 years<br />
until trying again in earnest. All the while wishing I was my own<br />
boss, but not feeling ready to make the leap. Fear of failure was a<br />
big part of that, as well as many other fears, like not being able to<br />
pay my child support obligations.</p>
<p>As for overcoming the fear, I&#8217;m guessing that everyone is going to<br />
have different tipping points. One commonality though, is probably to<br />
give yourself distance from the culture of fear that permeates our<br />
world. I did away with my &#8220;normal&#8221; television watching habits a long<br />
time ago <del>- nowadays our television goes weeks without being turned on<br />
-</del> most commercials prey on pervasive fear culture of our society.<br />
Fear of death, fear of getting sick, fear of accidents, of not being<br />
successful enough.  Get rid of it!</p>
<p>If you really want to succeed, you have to distance yourself from<br />
whiners and low-achievers too. We all have toxic people in our lives,<br />
you gotta put space between you and them if you want to overcome the<br />
fear and negativity that they breed.</p>
<p>My tipping point to success was building a solid reputation online via<br />
my blog and getting so good at what I was doing that I didn&#8217;t have to<br />
particularly worry about going back to fulltime employment if I<br />
happened to fall flat on my face as an independent.</p>
<h2>Is there a place for fixed bid projects in the world of Rails consulting? What would you say are the pros and cons? I&#8217;ve had very bad experience with fixed bid projects in large companies. I&#8217;m wondering if there&#8217;s a way to do it right.</h2>
<p>I think fixed-bid contracting for custom web applications is a<br />
horrible idea, overall. I slept on this question for a few days and<br />
dug back in my memory over the last dozen years of consulting: I&#8217;ve<br />
never heard of anyone being happy with the outcome of a fixed-bid<br />
project.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem with fixed-bid is the fluid and living nature<br />
of all but the tiniest single-purpose webapps. Once you start<br />
development, there are going to be changes necessary. A lot of those<br />
will feel &#8220;easy&#8221; and/or &#8220;logical&#8221; as if they should have been included<br />
in the requirements to begin with. Pressure will be on to include<br />
those changes in the original budget, especially if you&#8217;re focused on<br />
customer service and keeping that client happy. Doubly so if the<br />
client is on a tight budget and simply doesn&#8217;t have more money to pay.<br />
Your hands are tied and odds are you&#8217;re going to suffer the<br />
consequences.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a &#8220;right&#8221; way to do fixed-bid. You&#8217;d have to<br />
have a really awesome and understanding client and implement a very<br />
rigorous change-control policy that I suspect would encumber the whole<br />
development process to a large and unenjoyable degree.</p>
<p>If possible, invest the time in helping your client to understand the<br />
nature of variable scope and why it&#8217;s in their best interest.</p>
<p>(Note: Obie recently covered this topic on his own weblog <a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2009/02/explain-variable-scope-with-ponies.html">here</a>)</p>
<h2>Hashrocket currently focuses on Rails projects. Do you see any technologies coming up that you might focus some or all of the team on?</h2>
<p>No, not right now. I&#8217;m very focused on being the best of the best in<br />
one particular niche: large-scale, custom web application development.<br />
And I don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s any technology that even comes close to<br />
what you get with Rails for that. There&#8217;s always lots of cool and<br />
exciting new things going on, the latest craze seems to be iPhone<br />
development. We have a number of people interested in that, but I will<br />
not take the company in that direction. It would be detrimental to<br />
lose focus from what we do best.</p>
<h2>What if I&#8217;m a developer who has no dreams of becoming an entrepreneur&#8230;what does it buy me to understand sales, marketing, managing client relationships and what-not?</h2>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re independently wealthy, when it comes to landing a good<br />
job and keeping it, you&#8217;re always going to have to hustle to promote<br />
yourself. Lessons in sales and marketing apply whether you&#8217;re selling<br />
a product, a company&#8217;s services or your own services. What are you<br />
doing when you prepare a resume? When you go on an interview? Selling!<br />
Get good at it, or suffer the crappy jobs and work environments that<br />
you will get otherwise.</p>
<p>As for client relationships, if someone is paying you, they&#8217;re your<br />
client. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you answer to another company or to a<br />
manager. The skills of maintaining a healthy relationship and knowing<br />
how to properly set expectations apply to everyone.</p>
<h2>Agile processes are obviously a cornerstone of your company. How do you draw the line between passion and dogma?</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s an interesting distinction. Passion is undeniably necessary for<br />
success. Without passion, without the ability to inspire others, via<br />
your words and/or actions, you&#8217;re not going to get very far in life. I<br />
believe that Agile software development &#8220;just is&#8221; and I&#8217;m very<br />
passionate about that. It just is the way that you do quality<br />
software. Not doing quality software? That&#8217;s fine, but I won&#8217;t work<br />
with you. Nowadays Agile is far enough along in mindshare that I don&#8217;t<br />
feel I have to sell it very much or get anywhere near dogmatic about<br />
it. As in everything, I try to keep an open mind and if a better<br />
philosophy evolves, maybe it&#8217;s &#8220;Lean Sofware&#8221; or maybe it&#8217;s something<br />
else, I&#8217;ll go with the flow. Until then, I stick to my principles.<br />
Passionately.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s got you excited these days outside of your programming and entrepreneurial life?</h2>
<p>I guess I&#8217;d have to say travel, more than anything else. Last year I<br />
was blessed to be able to take my kids on a few good vacations,<br />
including a fancy three-week trip around the world with stops in South<br />
Africa and Far East. This year it&#8217;s looking like I&#8217;m going to be<br />
spending a lot of time in Europe and South America, so I&#8217;m definitely<br />
excited about that. It&#8217;s a big world out there. Get out and see it<br />
while you still can!</p></div>
