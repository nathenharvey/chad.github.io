<div class="entry-content"><p>Next up in my <a href="http://chadfowler.com/railsconf-speaker-interviews">series of RailsConf speaker interviews</a> is <a href="http://mbleigh.com/">Michael Bleigh</a>, who is Creative Director and Open-Source Activist at <a href="http://intridea.com">Intridea</a> in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Michael will be presenting <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/8517">Twitter on Rails</a> at RailsConf this year, highlighting a small but growing trend of applications using Twitter as a communication platform.</p>
<h2>You work on <a href="https://www.presentlyapp.com">Present.ly</a> and you&#8217;re<br />
giving a talk on Twitter apps at RailsConf. Micro-update services is<br />
obviously a topic that has you excited. Why is that?</h2>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t a super-early adopter of Twitter; I honestly think it&#8217;s<br />
something that takes some time to &#8220;get.&#8221; Then one day I woke up and<br />
realized that without even trying I was getting all kinds of news and<br />
information that I might not even have heard otherwise. The beauty of<br />
Twitter (and Present.ly for teams and organizations) is that it&#8217;s a<br />
fast, passive medium: you don&#8217;t have to make an effort to keep up to<br />
date, it just sort of happens. It works with two-way communication,<br />
too; on our team if I have a quick syntax or sanity check question<br />
about my code, I post it up on Present.ly and get five responses<br />
within three minutes. Micro-updates excite me because I feel like I&#8217;m<br />
getting smarter just by glancing at growl notifications for a few<br />
seconds every couple of minutes while I&#8217;m working. It&#8217;s effortless.</p>
<h2>What are the coolest Twitter applications you&#8217;ve seen?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to pick out just a few; from a client perspective I&#8217;ve been<br />
using <a href="http://thecosmicmachine.com/">EventBox</a> lately. It&#8217;s integrated<br />
Twitter search feeds are really useful for keeping an eye on all of<br />
Intridea&#8217;s brands (as well as my plugins and open-source projects).<br />
While I don&#8217;t think anyone has nailed it perfectly yet, aggregators<br />
like <a href="http://tweetmeme.com/">TweetMeme</a> are interesting in their<br />
attempts to bubble up content from the noise. Honestly, I don&#8217;t think<br />
there are just a couple cool apps; I think that Twitter&#8217;s true<br />
strength is this really energetic ecosystem around creating cool stuff<br />
with the <span class="caps">API</span>. That&#8217;s what my talk is all about: lowering the barriers<br />
to people making cool stuff with Twitter. With the hundreds of apps<br />
currently available I still think we&#8217;ve only scratched the surface of<br />
the utility that Twitter-based applications can provide.</p>
<h2>What does it mean to be &#8220;Open Source Activist&#8221; for a company?<br />
Should other companies fill this role?</h2>
<p>As the &#8220;Open Source Activist&#8221; I&#8217;m basically just trying to push people<br />
to package up what they&#8217;re doing and share it with the community,<br />
whether it&#8217;s through a Ruby gem, a plugin, or just a blog post. My<br />
colleagues are making cool stuff all of the time, and sharing that<br />
cool stuff with the community is absolutely beneficial for the<br />
company, the individual, and everyone who finds it useful. We&#8217;ve had<br />
clients come to us and when they&#8217;re vetting our work it&#8217;ll be &#8220;Oh<br />
yeah, I&#8217;ve used that plugin! You guys wrote that?&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that every company needs someone who is pushing for that<br />
community involvement. Pushing for us to blog more often and release<br />
more open source doesn&#8217;t just yield intangible reputation benefits:<br />
I&#8217;ve learned really cool techniques from other people at Intridea that<br />
they used for a project on which I&#8217;m not currently working. I&#8217;m always<br />
excited to foster that kind of sharing environment because the rewards<br />
are just great. I could go on for hours and I strongly encourage that<br />
every company working with Ruby or Rails try to release at least a few<br />
open-source libraries and write some blog posts to share your<br />
knowledge and expertise with the world at large.</p>
<p>We really believe in putting our money where our mouth is on the<br />
open-source front. When we wrote mobile applications for Present.ly on<br />
five different platforms it was a no-brainer to me to <a href="http://github.com/presently">release them<br />
all as open-source</a>. Open source, open<br />
APIs and open communication foster innovation in amazing ways, and<br />
anything I can do to make that happen more often I will.</p>
<h2>Why is Twitter Search special and/or interesting?</h2>
<p>Twitter Search is special because it&#8217;s intrinsically a different beast<br />
than Google and other search engines. It&#8217;s not indexing information,<br />
it&#8217;s indexing <b>conversation</b>, and it does it in real time. If I&#8217;m<br />
trying to find information about something that happened in the last<br />
24 hours (like <a href="http://intridea.com/2009/1/22/twitter-search-plus-find-replies-inline-with-twitter-search">who was that old woman on Lost?</a>), I don&#8217;t use Google<br />
anymore; I turn to Twitter because it will have up-to-the-second<br />
information that just isn&#8217;t available anywhere else. Obviously it<br />
doesn&#8217;t replace the usefulness of other search engines, but it opens<br />
up whole new channels of information discovery. Honestly search and<br />
Twitter are such a natural and amazing fit that it&#8217;s surprising that<br />
it took a third party (Summize) to come along and realize that<br />
potential. I really look forward to where they (and third parties) are<br />
going to take the technology in the next year or two.</p>
<h2>As I understand it, Intridea started as a consulting group but has<br />
quickly developed a set of products that have gotten some positive<br />
press. How do you balance consulting and product development? Do they<br />
support and feed off of each other?</h2>
<p>The balance actually works really well. We have a few people full time<br />
on products and then we rotate in services people either part-time or<br />
full-time depending on our client engagements at the time. I think<br />
it&#8217;s been great for both sides of the company to have both services<br />
and products: we can try really bleeding edge and experimental things<br />
on the products and then bring that knowledge to the client work we<br />
do. Likewise, everyone at Intridea on the services side has an almost<br />
inhuman work ethic and an ability to juggle several projects at once<br />
so when they come on to the products they can pick it up fast and get<br />
things done. Consulting has also allowed us to try a number of<br />
products without ever having to accept outside funding.</p>
<p>A number of our products also grew out of needs that clients would<br />
have again and again. For instance <a href="http://scalr.net">Scalr</a> is a great<br />
piece of software (don&#8217;t ask me about how it works, it&#8217;s over my<br />
head!) that gives us the ability to provide amazing scalable cloud<br />
hosting to our clients. <a href="http://www.gomediaplug.com/">MediaPlug</a><br />
similarly provides an easy infrastructure that saves our clients time<br />
and money. We scratch our own itches with our products and that<br />
usually means that there are benefits for the consulting side of our<br />
business with every product we make. I&#8217;m honored and privileged to<br />
work with so many brilliant people and be allowed to pursue so many<br />
amazing ideas.</p></div>
