<div class="entry-content"><p>Next up in my <a href="http://chadfowler.com/railsconf-speaker-interviews">series of RailsConf speaker interviews</a> is <a href="http://subelsky.com/">Mike Subelsky</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://otherinbox.com">OtherInbox</a> and avid <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/">SproutCore</a> developer. (SproutCore was used, among other things, to develop Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://me.com">MobileMe</a> UI and presents a Cocoa-like environment for developing Rich browser-based user interfaces.)</p>
<p>Mike will be presenting both a <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/speaker/2233">tutorial on SproutCore development and a session on cloud computing gotchas</a> at RailsConf in a couple of weeks.</p>
<h2>How did OtherInbox get started? Was this your first startup? What were the hurdles in moving from consulting to product development?</h2>
<p>We wanted to solve our own email overload problem &#8212; many people receive heavy volumes of &#8220;gray mail&#8221; or &#8220;bacn&#8221; and increasing volumes of more important email like receipts, social networking notifications, confirmations, etc.  The other founder of the company, <a href="http://austinpreneur.com/">Joshua Baer</a>, had the idea to build a product that would elegantly organize and make sense of this kind of mail, something we would use ourselves that would also help the average person.</p>
<p>This was my first startup; I knew Josh from a project class we had taken together at Carnegie Mellon and was lucky that he invited me to be the cofounder.  I had been dabbling and freelancing as a Rails developer for the previous 18 months, and had always been hacking on side projects for my whole career.</p>
<p>Coming from a consulting background, there have been two big hurdles:</p>
<ol>
	<li>I didn&#8217;t expect product development to have such a different tempo than consulting projects. You live with your code much longer (so you end up maintaining your own legacy code, and don&#8217;t have the next greenfield to look forward to), you have to deal more directly with the consequences of mistakes (there&#8217;s no one to bail you out), and the risks are higher (because you don&#8217;t know when or if your labors will pay off).  Thus there are many peaks and valleys of  happiness, and it&#8217;s not always easy to tell if you are being successful.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>When time and resources are so constrained, the development team has to become disciplined without sacrificing too much agility.  You can&#8217;t rely on individual programming heroics to carry the day &#8211; otherwise you&#8217;re guaranteed to burn out and get sloppy.  I haven&#8217;t completely overcome this hurdle yet, but I&#8217;m reading everything about software development processes that I can get my hands on.  I&#8217;ve become a huge fan of Eric Ries&#8217; lean startup blog <br />
<a href="http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/">Lessons Learned</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What makes SproutCore interesting and special to you?</h2>
<p>SproutCore lets you build real client-server applications, delegating a lot of <span class="caps">GUI</span> work to the client that servers currently perform (like rendering <span class="caps">HTML</span> views or serving up cached <span class="caps">HTML</span> pages).  The framework takes concepts that desktop developers have used for a long time and reimagines them for use in web applications.  For example, key-value observation and  bindings help you eliminate a lot of buggy, ugly glue code, saving a lot of time and aggravation).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s special to me because I think this technology has the potential to dramatically change application development in general.  The core team has a strong point of view about how Internet clients should be built, and how to make JavaScript and web browsers perform.  Writing SproutCore code reminds me of the feeling I got the first time I picked up a book about Rails &#8212; &#8220;using these tools is making me a better programmer&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;ve never liked the feel of Flash, and I love how SproutCore uses only web-native technologies to do amazing things in the browser.  <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/2009/03/25/papercube/">PaperCube</a> and <a href="http://me.com/">MobileMe</a> are examples of SproutCore apps that feel like desktop apps, but don&#8217;t require any plugins whatsoever.</p>
<h2>Are SproutCore and Rails particularly well suited to one another? If so, how?</h2>
<p>I think so &#8212; you can point a SproutCore client at any kind of server you want, but I think there&#8217;s probably a sweet spot for these two frameworks. Rails makes it easy to write a robust, easily extensible <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span>, which makes it really easy to write web clients.  SproutCore makes it easy to write robust, easily extensible web clients.</p>
<p>In OtherInbox, our Rails app has to worry about doing is sending back <span class="caps">JSON</span> as quickly as possible.  The SproutCore app handles most of the user interaction (except for things like the signin page, which we&#8217;re keeping server-based for now)  and focuses on making the browser experience as fast and fluid as possible.  We don&#8217;t need to run as many web servers to keep up with our recent growth, because the servers aren&#8217;t bogged down generating <span class="caps">HTML</span> or <span class="caps">RJS</span> updates.</p>
<p>As a happy side-effect, since we built our app this way, someone has <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/otherinbox/topics/android_app_coming_is_there_an_api">reverse engineered</a> <br />
our <span class="caps">JSON</span> <span class="caps">API</span> to make an Android app.</p>
<p>Rails developers will also find many cultural similarities such as emphasis on unit testing and use of generators.</p>
<h2>SproutCore&#8217;s model marks an extreme departure from the way we traditionally do JavaScript/<span class="caps">AJAX</span> applications on Rails. Do you think SproutCore or its patterns will catch on generally or is it bettered toward to a specific niche?</h2>
<p>I think if you&#8217;re building an app where you need to add just a little dynamic behavior here and there, SproutCore is too much.  Toolkits like Prototype and jQuery are much more appropriate.  But if you&#8217;re making something like MobileMe, PaperCube, or <a href="http://oib.com/">OtherInbox</a>, where the users expect desktop-like fluidity or where the client software can&#8217;t always rely on the server for everything, SproutCore will be a big win.</p>
<p>One thing that could help SproutCore catch on generally will be its support for multiple platforms.  The 1.0 release candidate includes <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/2009/03/15/sproutcore-goes-mobile/">preliminary mobile support</a>, <br />
so we should eventually be able to take the same code base and build it for web browsers, iPhones, Androids, etc., without having to change much.  I think that will really turn some heads.</p>
<h2>SproutCore&#8217;s learning curve appears to be pretty steep. What&#8217;s the best way to get into it on day one?</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s tough, because there aren&#8217;t yet a lot of blogs or books to guide you.  One of my goals for 2009 is to start contributing more tutorials, because I was lucky to be mentored by <a href="http://twitter.com/erichocean">Erich Ocean</a>.  My best advice would be to get some familiarity with Cocoa because that will illuminate the parts of desktop development that are really different from web development.  If you understand <br />
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html">key-value observation</a>, <br />
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/KeyValueCoding.html">key-value coding</a>, and bindings, it will be much easier to learn SproutCore.</p>
<p>Also, the #sproutcore <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sproutcore">Google group</a> are really friendly places to get guidance.</p></div>
