<div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago, sitting in the July heat on a wall in the Harajuku district of Tokyo, I came to a conclusion: I had let myself be a loser. At least, I had let myself become a partial loser. I was fat and unhappy. My skin looked grey. I was slowly killing myself. I was obese. I made excuses to myself and others. I used my success in other areas as a justification: I just wasn&#8217;t a fitness guy.</p>
<p><strong>It was bullshit.</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>These days I&#8217;m still not an elite athlete, but I&#8217;ve turned things around. I&#8217;ve lost nearly 100 pounds, gone from a max ability to run 45 seconds at a time to running a half marathon, and lost 10 inches around my waist.</p>

</p>
<p>Before, I was incomplete. I allowed myself to believe in a partial picture of myself.  Now, I&#8217;m closer to the real me. I&#8217;m still a smart, creative guy. But I can also do more pushups in a row than the average American male, and can run longer and faster than most guys my age. And I feel great. I feel noticeably better almost all the time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m often asked by other obese and overweight people how I did it. People see me at conferences and other venues and literally don&#8217;t recognize me. How did I make such an incredible transformation?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve asked me this question, this post is for you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long story. But I&#8217;m going to give you the very very short version:  it was easy.</p>
<p>I could tell you exactly which system I devised and exactly what worked for me. But that would be missing the major point. The most important element of making a change like this is that it is <em>easy</em>.</p>
<p><strong>If you could trade your body for one that is 50-100% better in a year, what would you give? </strong> If you had asked me in early 2008, I wouldn&#8217;t have even believed it possible. I would have given a lot. What about 6 months? Obese or overweight people, what if I told you that in 6 months you could be in almost unrecognizably better shape? Would you jump on whatever I was selling?</p>
<p>The secret? I&#8217;m not selling anything. It&#8217;s just true. Choose <em>any</em> non-bullshit system and actually stick with it for 6 months and you can and will experience life-changing results. You can extend your life span significantly.</p>
<h2>If you&#8217;re reading this and you want to change, here&#8217;s what I want you to do:</h2>
<p>1. Recognize how deep in denial you&#8217;ve been<br />
2. Measure yourself now. If it&#8217;s weight that&#8217;s your issue, get on the scale immediately. Stand on it and cry. You probably haven&#8217;t been measuring it, and it&#8217;s probably worse than you think. Embrace how far you&#8217;ve gone in the wrong direction.  This is the end of that long, drawn out series of lies you&#8217;ve been telling yourself.<br />
3. Find any program that doesn&#8217;t look like snake oil and try it for 20 days. Measure your progress. If you don&#8217;t know what to try, start with 45 minute light cardiovascular exercise sessions 4 times per week (find a TV series to watch on a treadmill&#8230;a one hour show without commercials is about 42 minutes), forcing yourself to eat a protein-heavy breakfast within 30 minutes of waking, cutting out empty calories and sugars (coke, sugar-heavy &#8220;coffee&#8221; drinks, beer, etc.), and eating 5 small meals per day.<br />
4. After 20 days, you&#8217;re almost 1/6 of the way through a major transformation.  You have probably gone down one clothing size or are close to it. How far do you want to go? Pick something you didn&#8217;t previously think you were capable of and commit to it. Maybe it&#8217;s a bike race or a triathlon or doing Cross Fit.</p>
<p>The funny thing about huge change is that making it happen isn&#8217;t usually as huge an effort as we think. We just get stuck. All you have to do to go <span class="caps">ALL</span> of the way is to go <span class="caps">SOME</span> of the way.</p>
<p><i><br />
Note: I wrote a more detailed account of my weight loss story in <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com">Tim Ferriss&#8217;s</a> best selling book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/030746363X">The Four Hour Body</a>. I have no financial interest in the book, but having re-read my own chapter when Tim sent me a copy of the book last December, I was inspired enough to double down on my efforts to go from OK to awesome. I&#8217;ve lost 20 more pounds since January 1.  Tim&#8217;s advice for weight loss is solid, and (if I do say so myself) my chapter alone is worth the cost of the book.</p>
